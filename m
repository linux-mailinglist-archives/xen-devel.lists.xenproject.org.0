That is what I thought and it is why I was asking to clarify the naming
and/or writing a document to explain the assumptions, if any.

Then after Julien's email I followed up in the Linux codebase and
clearly there is a different assumption baked in the Linux kernel for
architectures that have CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS enabled (including ARM64).

The assumption is that segment == domain == unique host bridge. It
looks like it is coming from IEEE Std 1275-1994 but I am not certain.
In fact, it seems that ACPI MCFG and IEEE Std 1275-1994 don't exactly
match. So I am starting to think that domain == segment for IEEE Std
1275-1994 compliant device tree based systems.

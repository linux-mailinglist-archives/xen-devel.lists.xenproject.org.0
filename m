I can't seem to be able to guess what C99 feature(s) you mean.
If there are any that would help, why not use them?

Above from here is a read from MSR_IA32_PLATFORM_ID - any reason
it doesn't also get folded?

In the write path you also abstract out the check for v being current.
Wouldn't this better be abstracted out here, too, as reading an actual
MSR when not current isn't generally very helpful?

I have to admit that I'd find it more logical if v was now used
here instead of curr.

Didn't you indicate more than once that you dislike mixing 0x-
prefixed and non-prefixed hex values in a single message?
(Personally I'd simple drop the #, but I expect you to prefer it
the other way around.)

Also both here and in the read path I'm unconvinced of the
"by handing #GP back" wording: When v != curr, no #GP fault can
typically be handed anywhere. And even when v == curr it's still
up to the caller to decide what to do. IOW how about "by
suggesting to hand back #GP" or some such?

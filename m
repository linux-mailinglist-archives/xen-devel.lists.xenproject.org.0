Interesting that for VS-stage translation is explicitly mention that it is
possible to stop speculation:
   No mechanism is provided to atomically change vsatp and hgatp together.
   Hence, to prevent speculative execution causing one guestâ€™s VS-stage
   translations to be cached under another guestâ€™s VMID, world-switch code
   should zero vsatp, then swap hgatp, then finally write the new vsatp value.
   Similarly, if henvcfg.PBMTE need be world-switched, it should be switched
   after zeroing vsatp but before writing the new vsatp value, obviating
   the need to execute an HFENCE.VVMA instruction.
So if VSATP is 0 then there is no speculation as there is no need to execute
HFENCE.VVMA.

"VMID use is disabled" really sounds more clear. Thanks.

a hart really speculate into guest mode, when the hart is only in the
process of being brought up?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">I couldn't explicit words that a hart can't speculate into guest mode
either on bring up or during its work.

But there are some moments in the spec which tells:
   Implementations with virtual memory are permitted to perform address
   translations speculatively and earlier than required by an explicit
   memory access, and are permitted to cache them in address translation
   cache structuresâ€”including possibly caching the identity mappings from
   effective address to physical address used in Bare translation modes and
   M-mode.
And here:
   Implementations may also execute the address-translation algorithm
   speculatively at any time, for any virtual address, as long as satp is
   active (as defined in Section 10.1.11). Such speculative executions have
   the effect of pre-populating the address-translation cache.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">That's satp though, not hgatp.

</pre><blockquote type="cite" style="color: #007cff;"><pre wrap=""
      class="moz-quote-pre">Where it is explicitly mentioned that speculation can happen in <b
      class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any time<span
      class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.
And at the same time:
   Speculative executions of the address-translation algorithm behave as
   non-speculative executions of the algorithm do, except that they must
   not set the dirty bit for a PTE, they must not trigger an exception,
   and they must not create address-translation cache entries if those
   entries would have been invalidated by any SFENCE.VMA instruction
   executed by the hart since the speculative execution of the algorithm began.
What I read as if TLB was empty before it will stay empty.

Also, despite of the fact here it is mentioned that when V=0 two-stage address
translation is inactivated:
   The current virtualization mode, denoted V, indicates whether the hart is
   currently executing in a guest. When V=1, the hart is either in virtual
   S-mode (VS-mode), or in virtual U-mode (VU-mode) atop a guest OS running
   in VS-mode. When V=0, the hart is either in M-mode, in HS-mode, or in
   U-mode atop an OS running in HS-mode. The virtualization mode also
   indicates whether two-stage address translation is active (V=1) or
   inactive (V=0).
But on the same side, writing to hgatp register activates it:
   The hgatp register is considered active for the purposes of
   the address-translation algorithm unless the effective privilege mode
   is U and hstatus.HU=0.
And if so + considering that speculation could happen at any time, and
we are in HS-mode, not it U mode then I would say that it could really
speculate into guest mode.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">Hmm, that leaves some things to be desired. What I'm particularly puzzled
by is that there's nothing said either way towards speculation through SRET.
That's the important aspect here aiui, because without that the hart can't
speculate into guest mode.

But yes, in the absence of any clear indication to the contrary, I think
you want to keep the local_hfence_gvma_all() (with a suitable comment).</pre></pre>

    <pre>Interesting that for VS-stage translation is explicitly mention that it is
possible to stop speculation:
  No mechanism is provided to atomically change vsatp and hgatp together.
  Hence, to prevent speculative execution causing one guestâ€™s VS-stage
  translations to be cached under another guestâ€™s VMID, world-switch code
  should zero vsatp, then swap hgatp, then finally write the new vsatp value.
  Similarly, if henvcfg.PBMTE need be world-switched, it should be switched
  after zeroing vsatp but before writing the new vsatp value, obviating
  the need to execute an HFENCE.VVMA instruction.
So if VSATP is 0 then there is no speculation as there is no need to execute
HFENCE.VVMA.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">Actually, what exactly does it mean that "VMIDs are disabled"? There's
no enable bit that I could find anywhere. Isn't it rather that in this
case you need to arrange to flush always on VM entry (or always after a
P2M change, depending how the TLB is split between guest and host use)?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">"VMIDs are disabled" here means that TLB flush will happen each time p2m
is changed.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">That's better described as "VMIDs aren't used" then?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">It sounds a little bit just like an opposite to "disabled" (i.e. means
basically the same), but I am okay to use "used" instead.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">If you want to stick to using "disabled", then how about "VMID use is
disabled"? (You probably meanwhile understood that what I'm after is it
becoming clear that this is a software decision, not something you can
enforce in hardware.)</pre></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>"VMID use is disabled" really sounds more clear. Thanks.

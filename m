Just to clarify: new features don't need to work on ARM or cause any
addition efforts to you to make them work on ARM. The patch series only
needs not to break existing code paths (on ARM and any other platforms).
It should also not make it overly difficult to implement the ARM side of
things (if there is one) at some point in the future.

FYI drivers/xen/manage.c is compiled and working on ARM today, however
Xen suspend/resume is not supported. I don't know for sure if
guest-initiated hibernation works because I have not tested it.

That is a good principle to have and thanks for suggesting it. However,
in this specific case there is nothing in this patch that doesn't work
on ARM. From an ARM perspective I think we should enable it and
&xen_pm_notifier_block should be registered.

Given that all guests are HVM guests on ARM, it should work fine as is.


I gave a quick look at the rest of the series and everything looks fine
to me from an ARM perspective. I cannot imaging that the new freeze,
thaw, and restore callbacks for net and block are going to cause any
trouble on ARM. The two main x86-specific functions are
xen_syscore_suspend/resume and they look trivial to implement on ARM (in
the sense that they are likely going to look exactly the same.)


One question for Anchal: what's going to happen if you trigger a
hibernation, you have the new callbacks, but you are missing
xen_syscore_suspend/resume?

Is it any worse than not having the new freeze, thaw and restore
callbacks at all and try to do a hibernation?

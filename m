Why? This has always been our process. We should not ship 4.18 with the 
UNSTABLE section. So it was correct to delete it in d9f07b06cfc9.

I disagree. 4.19 will not be fully re-open until we finally release. So 
I wouldn't expect any new features to be merged.

If you want to go down that route, then please update the 
docs/process/branching-checklist.txt. Otherwise, I will continue to do 
as I did previously.

Yeah, unfortunately I haven't found a way in gitlab UI to explicitly
specify the people that have commit access to a repository. It can be
done at the https://gitlab.com/xen-project level but not for
xen-integration only. 

Unrelated but FYI, I also haven't found a way to let someone just
trigger gitlab-ci runs without also being able to commit to a tree.

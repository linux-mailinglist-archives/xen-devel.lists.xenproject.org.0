I think at that point it was mostly an allow list that enabled me to
boot PVH on the systems I was testing.  I don't think it was intended
to be complete, but rather something that we would expand as needed.
There where many and bigger missing pieces of PVH dom0 when that was
committed.

I cannot find any reference about: FIDT, MIGT, NITR, SVOS and WDDT in
the ACPI spec.

The MSCT I think we don't want to expose, as it's related to topology
data.

Regarding RASF I would be slightly worried about the patrol scrub
feature.  The memory map exposed to dom0 will be different from the
native one, and there's also the interposed p2m.

The rest are likely fine to expose.

I may have put this ahead of the loop, so that the goto label doesn't
go backwards (which always feels weird to me).

I wonder if additionally we should print tables filtered to dom0 here:

if ( opt_dom0_verbose )
    printk("Hidden ACPI Table %.4s\n", sig);

So that it's more obvious which tables are not exposed.

Thanks, Roger.

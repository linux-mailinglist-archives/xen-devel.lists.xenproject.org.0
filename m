I find that impossible to reconcile with your normal review feedback.

It is unconditionally forced out of line because of how it's used,
meaning that if it ever got used in a second translation unit we'd end
up with a duplicate function, at which point it would need to be
non-static and exported to pass review.Â  (And sanity.)

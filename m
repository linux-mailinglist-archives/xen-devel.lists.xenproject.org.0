Yes - I consider that an accident at best, and not something which
people can reasonably be expected to know or use.

If nothing else, the pv form is the more useful one to use, given a
potential pvh-dom0 future where CONFIG_PV might credibly be dropped by
downstreams.

Thanks, but CI still says no.

Some compilers don't tolerate the lack of a return value in a non-void
function, despite the ASSERT_UNREACHABLE().Â  It might be down to the
absence of __builtin_unreahcable().

I've folded "return 0;" into the two get stubs, and will see how that
fairs, but given how trivial it is, I don't intend to post a v2 before
committing.

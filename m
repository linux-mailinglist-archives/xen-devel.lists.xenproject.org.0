Really? I can believe that NULL may be returned but a crash... If that's 
the case, then this should be fixed.

So I misunderstood the implementation of is_domain_llc_colored(). I 
would have thought it was based on whether the domain has colors. But 
instead, it is based on whether coloring is enabled globally.

So I agree that the checks are not necessary today. But if 
is_domain_llc_colored() is changed, then this may not be correct anymore.

So I think there are some clarifications required. If the 'd' will never 
matter, then probably is_domain_llc_colored() should be removed. If not, 
then we want to add the check in the domctl (or at minimum document it).

Fair enough. But the first step is to make the sure the code is correct 
and Xen doesn't crash. We can then discuss about avoiding arch specific 
code.

BTW, all your LLC code is implemented in arch/arm. So if it is really 
intended to contain zero arch specific code, then shouldn't it be 
implemented in common/?

Cheers,

Indeed, I would expect that.

Would have to look into more detail, but I think leaving any relocs
for the OS to perform would be my initial approach.

I've created a gitlab ticket for it:

https://gitlab.com/xen-project/xen/-/issues/180

So that we don't forget, as I don't have time to work into this right
now, but I think it's important enough that we don't forget.

For PV it's a bit more unclear how we want to deal with it, as it's
IMO a specific Linux behavior that makes it fail to boot.

Roger.

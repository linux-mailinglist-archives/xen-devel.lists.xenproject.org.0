Ah yes. But this is just one way of things possibly going wrong. Plus
the function will return true when ->defer_shutdown is already or
(wrongly) still set.

Consider the case of one getting destroyed after it has already
returned data, but the originating vCPU didn't consume that data
yet. Once that vCPU gets unpaused, handle_hvm_io_completion()
won't find the matching server anymore, and hence the chain
hvm_wait_for_io() -> hvm_io_assist() ->
vcpu_end_shutdown_deferral() would be skipped. handle_pio()
would then still correctly consume the result.

Marek - to verify this doesn't happen (sorry, my qemu knowledge
is rather limited, and hence I don't know whether this can
happen at all), could you also log hvm_destroy_ioreq_server()
invocations?

Jan

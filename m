This seems fairly reasonable, as it turns a guest crash into an #UD
AFAICT.

Is there any place suitable to document this behavior?

Would this result in a regression for NetBSD then? Is it fine to see
#UD regardless of the platform? It's not clear to me from the text
above whether this change will cause issues with NetBSD.

I agree (in particular given the observations), but I don't view
this as an argument against use of -ffreestanding. In fact I'd
rather see this change re-based on top of Andrew's changes. Then ...

... the initial part of the comment here would want re-wording.

Could I talk you into extending this to also cover __P64__? (The
alternative I see would be to omit this altogether.)

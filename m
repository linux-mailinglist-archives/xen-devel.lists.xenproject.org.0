My concern is there is a disconnect. From the code, it is not obvious at 
all that parse_colors() only want to accept an array of nr_colors. If 
you pass an extra argument (or re-use the one you pass) for the array 
size and use within the code, then it makes more obvious that your array 
is always the correct size.

At least to me, this is a good practice in C to always pass the array 
and its size together (other language have that embedded). But I can 
appreciate this is not view like that for everyone. The minimum would be 
to document this requirement in a comment

I don't really see the problem here. Your code doesn't need to use the 
global variable.

I am fine with that.

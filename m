Not sure, to be honest. It seemed more logical to me to place it
next to where the issue is.

The compiler appears to be issuing the warning when it can prove
that no legitimate index can make it to a respective use. in this
case it means that is is

        if ( this_cpu == cpu )
            continue;

which makes it possible for the compiler to know that what gets
past this would be an out of bounds access, since for NR_CPUS=1
both this_cpu and cpu can only validly both be zero. (This also
plays into my choice of placement, because it is not
x2apic_cluster() on its own which has this issue.)

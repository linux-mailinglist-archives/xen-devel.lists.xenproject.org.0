Oh, okay; didn't think of looking at the numbers in the test.

Latency and throughput of DIV are quite a bit higher than those of memory
reads, assuming such reads come from a relatively hot cacheline. Then
again comparing such merely from spelled out numbers in some docs usually
doesn't work overly well.

In the example above far less than a page should be needed. In general I'd
expect one array slot per (contiguous chunk on a) node.

Except that, the fewer entries such an array would have, the hotter the
cacheline(s) can be expected to be anyway. But yes, gaining a clear
picture may be difficult. Then again please recall that my earlier
patching attempt (using BMI2 insns) was also rejected mainly on the
basis that the insns chosen are known to not perform well on some
hardware, without having taken any actual numbers (which again would
have been difficult to obtain in a representable way) into account.

Overall I'm not sure this alternative if worth trying out. I merely
wanted to point out there possibly is such an alternative, given the
concern Andrew had voiced. In the end there may be similar concerns
here ...

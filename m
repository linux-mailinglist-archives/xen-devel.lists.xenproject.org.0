This check being the same as in errata_c6_eoi_workaround(),
why don't you simply extend that function? (See also below.)
Also both variable and command line option descriptor could
go inside the function, to limit their scopes.

I realize you only add to existing code, but I'm afraid this
existing code cannot be safely added to. Already prior to
your change there was a curious mismatch of C3 and c6 on this
line, and I don't see how ACPI_STATE_C3 correlates with
"core C6" state. Now this may have been the convention for
Nehalem/Westmere systems, but already the mwait-idle entries
for these CPU models have 4 entries (albeit such that they
match this scheme). As a result I think this at the very
least needs to be >=, not ==, even more so now that you want
to cover all Intel CPUs.

Obviously (I think) it is a mistake that mwait-idle doesn't
also activate this workaround, which imo is another reason to
stick to just errata_c6_eoi_workaround().

Here it becomes even more relevant I think that == not be
used, as the static tables list deeper C-states; it's just
that the SKX table, which also gets used for CLX afaict, has
no entries beyond C6-SKX. Others with deeper ones presumably
have the deeper C-states similarly affected (or not) by this
erratum.

For reference, mwait_idle_cpu_init() has

		hint = flg2MWAIT(cpuidle_state_table[cstate].flags);
		state = MWAIT_HINT2CSTATE(hint) + 1;
                ...
		cx->type = state;

i.e. the value you compare against is derived from the static
table entries. For Nehalem/Westmere this means that what goes
under ACPI_STATE_C3 is indeed C6-NHM, and this looks to match
for all the non-Atoms, but for none of the Atoms. Now Atoms
could easily be unaffected, but (just to take an example) if
C6-SNB was affected, surely C7-SNB would be, too.

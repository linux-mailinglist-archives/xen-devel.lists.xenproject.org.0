And which one is "the previous call"? I'm still getting the
impression you're mixing up cleanup_domain_irq_pirq() and
clear_domain_irq_pirq(). (I guess we need to resort to line
numbers in current staging or master, to avoid
misunderstandings. Not for the commit message [if any], but
for the discussion.)

No, for the moment I don't agree yet, because I don't see
the redundancy so far.

I wouldn't mind, but yes, besides review difficulties ...

... this also wouldn't be overly nice (but can be dealt with
via a few more steps wading through git history).

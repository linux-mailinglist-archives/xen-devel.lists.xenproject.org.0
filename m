Hi Julien,

Yes, I remember a thread on xen-devel too about this topic when EPAM
suggested a similar two-hostbridges approach. I was one of the people
suggesting to use a single hostbridge at the time.

However, when we looked at the implementation more closely, the
two-hostbridge approach was easier to get up and running. It works
(almost) out of the box. Currently, we have the two-hostbridge solution
working on both ARM and x86 to enable virtio-pci to work alongside vPCI
in Dom0less/Hyperlaunch configurations.

While I think that a single hostbridge is better architecturally, it is
important to consider that virtio is moving toward a new transport
(virtio-msg, Bertrand is also involved) which does not require a
hostbridge. This new transport is key for all our use-cases as it
addresses safety requirements and supports AMP configurations without a
shared hypervisor between the frontend and backend. Edgar is one of the
top contributors to virtio-msg. Given this, I don't think it's
worthwhile to invest much effort in virtio-pci, as it will be replaced
soon in embedded applications.

Cheers,
Stefano

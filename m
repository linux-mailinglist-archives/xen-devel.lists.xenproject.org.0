As you probably know the end goal for Luca (and the Xen FuSa SIG as a
whole) is to generate all FuSa documents, including requirements docs,
interface docs, etc.

FuSa requires us to follow the famous V model, where the high level
requirements are linked to the lower level requirements, which are
linked to the interface docs, which are linked all the way down to the
code.

Maintaining the linking is difficult and typically done with expensive
proprietary FuSa tools.

Fortunately, an engineer working with the Zephyr project developed a set
of scripts for Doxygen that are able to generate the required FuSa docs
and also links from in-code comments and markdown/rst docs in the tree.

This is great work, and in the FuSa SIG we thought it would be best to
align ourselves with Zephyr to be able to pull our efforts together on
the tooling side instead of doing the same thing again on our own.

This is the reason why we ended up with Doxygen.

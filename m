Well, maybe. Even up-to-date gcc still supports -gstabs. Plus I seem
to have a vague recollection that Andrew objected to their removal
at some (not overly distant) point. I can't find any reference there
though, so Andrew: Do you have any specific thoughts here?

Of course with the stabs sections gone, .comment would remain. I'm
very firm in not wanting to leave any statements there putting
sections at VA zero. Irrespective of .comment (to take this example)
being listed under /DISCARD/ for PE. This would only be acceptable
(to me) if ld would always have at least warned about such sections.

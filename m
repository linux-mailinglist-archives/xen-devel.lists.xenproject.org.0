At the moment we have a concrete problem with explaining dom0less and
hyperlaunch to potential new users. Using two different names for a
similar feature on arm and x86 causes confusion. It is hurting Xen as a
solution. Personally I already had to switch to use the word
"hyperlaunch" for everything in my users-facing presentations.

At the summit, we discussed that it would be a good idea to use a single
name to refer to both features on arm and x86. Given that "dom0less"
causes additional issues because it makes people think that there is no
Dom0, the suggestion was to use "hyperlaunch" to refer to both features.

We don't need to 100% align the two implementations and data structures.
This is not for engineers that are going to look at the specifications
and improve them. This is for users/customers of Xen that are trying to
understand what the hypervisor enables them to do. We need to be able to
show users architecture slides with the same name and explanation on
both ARM and x86.

I am sure that Daniel and Christopher remember, but for the others on
this email thread, the name "hyperlaunch" was born exactly to be that:
the one name to cover both features on ARM and x86 even if they have a
different implementation. Appended an old email for reference.

Also I agree with Daniel that we need to be careful about the two docs
under docs/. I think he is right we need to add a paragraph explaining
the history and a pointer to the other document. Something like:

"Dom0less is the name that was used when initially introducing the
feature on ARM. Then, the "dom0less" name was retired in favor of
"hyperlaunch" to avoid confusion (a Dom0 might still be present) and to
align with x86 (where a similar feature was called hyperlaunch from the
start)."

Subject: [RFP] Overarching name for dom0less and DomB

Greetings,

At the DeviceTree/DomB meeting it was proposed that a new, larger
overarching name under which DomB and dom0less would be covered. There
was a general openness to the idea. As such, since Christopher and
myself are in the midst of finalizing the design document for DomB we
felt it might be better to see if a name could be selected which we
could use in the design doc in lieu of DomB. As always naming things is
hard, but after some brainstorming we believe we have arrived at a
decent name, Î¼Launch (micro-Launch or uLaunch).

---

Î¼Launch became hyperlaunch few days after, and the rest was history :-)

Imo really that's another case that would best be addressed by proper
ref-counting. Each VF would hold a ref to its PF, and hence the PF would
go away when the last VF is removed, or when PF removal is (properly)
last. Just that this likely is too complex a change to be warranted for
the purpose here.

I don't think that's how it's supposed to work. Physical removal should
occur only after software has done all "soft removal". I'd view the
notification to Xen as part of that.

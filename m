Would seem so to me, yes. Knowing how hard it was back at the time
to find any doc on the 8259A at all, and knowing that the doc that
initially became available wasn't very complete, I could very well
imagine the present doc still being incomplete. Let me see if I
can get something out of Intel.

Right, that's what I was considering too. (Really I was
thinking to propagate the "unmasked" value from ICW1
processing to when init_state gets cleared, but you're
right about a stray call to pt_may_unmask_irq() not doing
any harm.)

That testing consideration goes as well for the correctness
of what we have right now. It functions for the very limited
set of modes typical OSes use, and likely nobody really
knows whether it would also function correctly when used in
"exotic" ways.

As to pre-patch or follow-up: For this latter aspect it
probably doesn't matter much. If any adjustment is made
affecting the code further up, it may want to be a pre-patch
though, as it may change how you want to exit (e.g. I'd
expect the "goto" to possibly go away).

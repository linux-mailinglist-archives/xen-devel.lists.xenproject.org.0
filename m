Ok so I think I am lot confused by this question. Here is what this
function for, function xen_is_xen_suspend() just tells us whether 
the guest is in "SHUTDOWN_SUSPEND" state or not. This check is needed
for correct invocation of syscore_ops callbacks registered for guest's
hibernation and for xenbus to invoke respective callbacks[suspend/resume
vs freeze/thaw/restore].
Since "shutting_down" state is defined static and is not directly available
to other parts of the code, the function solves the purpose.

I am having hard time understanding why this should be called pv
suspend/hibernation unless you are suggesting something else?
Am I missing your point here?

Ok makes sense. TBH, I haven't tested this part of code on ARM and the series
was only support x86 guests hibernation.
Moreover, this notifier is there to distinguish between 2 PM
events PM SUSPEND and PM hibernation. Now since we only care about PM
HIBERNATION I may just remove this code and rely on "SHUTDOWN_SUSPEND" state.
However, I may have to fix other patches in the series where this check may
appear and cater it only for x86 right?

I haven't tested it as a part of this series. Is that a blocker here?

Besides wanting to ping this change / discussion, I'd also like
to correct myself on this last part of the reply: The above
applies to pages after having got de-validated. However, prior
to validation pages have their type changed early (type ref count
remains zero), but at this point it can't be told yet whether the
page consists of all legal PTEs.

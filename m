This should already be the case, in the Xen model interrupts follow
vCPUs, so if you use pinning the vCPU should always be running
on the pCPU that's the target of the physical interrupt.

What about other external interrupts?  While the guest runs the
critical interrupt handling section with interrupts disabled, an
external interrupt from a device targeting the pCPU could cause a
vmexit.  I'm not aware of a nice way to solve this however, as for
PVH/HVM Xen doesn't know when the guest has finished interrupt
processing (iret).  Maybe this is not an issue in practice if you
isolate interrupts to different vCPUs (you might have to do this
already to ensure deterministic latency).

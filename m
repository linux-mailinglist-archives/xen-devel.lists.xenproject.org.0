In this case, I am not too concerned about not been able to reproduce 
it. However, I think it is a good practice to always post the setup 
along with the numbers.

This makes easier to understand the context of the patch and avoid 
spending time digging into the archives to find the original report.

Anyway, you already wrote everything above. So this is a matter of 
adding your first paragraph in the commit message + maybe a link to the 
original discussion(s).

Cheers,

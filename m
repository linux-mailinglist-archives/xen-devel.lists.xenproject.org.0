Consistency is my top concern. Let's put the "unsigned int" vs
"uint32_t" argument aside.

do_multicall is not consistent with itself. We need
hypercall-defs.c:do_multicall and multicall.c:do_multicall to match.

Option1) We can change hypercall-defs.c:do_multicall to use uint32_t.

Option2) Or we can change multicall.c:do_multicall to use unsigned int.

I went with Option1. Andrew expressed his strong preference toward
Option1 in the past. George seems to prefer Option1.

Jan, can you accept Option1 and move on?

Oh, TBL is fine with me. And perhaps indeed better, for being more precise.

Oh, indeed. But: Does this actually work? I'm not only slightly concerned
of PDX 0 (that may indeed be fine), but more as to mfn_valid(). An MFN below
the start of that region will still use index 0, aiui. (With the resulting
underflow, a huge PDX will result.) With PDX_TBL_MASK being zero, and with
there being only a single entry in both tables, the reverse translation will
use that single entry, simply undoing the underflowed subtraction. Hence
mfn_valid() would wrongly return true, afaict. (Thinking about it, the same
issue would appear to occur for MFNs above the sum of that range's start and
the region size.)

Hard to tell. They still take up decode bandwidth and at least some execution
resources, aiui. But perhaps you're right and that's indeed negligible, or at
least acceptable enough. Especially since, ...

... as you say, complexity would grow.

If there's a guarantee that such ranges would be folded into a single one,
all would be fine.

My understanding is that when there's no gap between regions, and when
[base, base + npages) crosses as region boundary, then the expression
above will yield true when, because of crossing a region boundary, it
ought to be false. Or did I simply misunderstand the purpose of the
pdx_is_region_compressible() invocations?

Hmm, right. Yet then isn't this another reason you need at least two array slots?
At least in the (theoretical) case of paddr_bits == 64? Which raises the question
whether the loop wouldn't better be bounded by paddr_bits anyway.

Isn't that true anyway? Before making it here, PDX and PFN have a fixed
(and hence wrong) relationship for the entire number space. And mfn_valid()
would yield true for any input no matter what the initializer, afaict. IOW
early uses look to be invalid anyway.

(Later) Oh, wait - your comment on pfn_pdx_compression_reset() made me
understand: We rely on identity mapping PDX <-> PFN if compression is
disabled, at least until alternatives patching arranges to bypass the
calculations.

But that's not what I meant. You can move the body of the earlier loop
into the later one, since - as said - the printk() between the two loops
doesn't use what the first loop does.

I see. It's the balancing between simplicity and making the reader (wrongly)
suspect a possible array overrun here (as it happened in my case). Maybe
keep the expressions as they are, but add a few words towards masking in the
text?

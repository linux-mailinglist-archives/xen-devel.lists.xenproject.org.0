You could already do that by writing your own XSM policy. Did you 
explore it? If so, may I ask why this wouldn't be suitable?

Also, I would like to emphasis that because of XSA-295 (Unlimited Arm 
Atomics Operations), you can only run emulators in trusted domain on Arm.

There would be more work to do if you wanted to run them in non-trusted 
environment.

I suggest to reword this as follows:

---
Dom0less guests would benefit from a statically-defined memory sharing
and signally system for communication. One that would be immediately
available at boot without any need for dynamic configurations.

In embedded a great variety of guest operating system kernels exist,
many of which don't have support for xenstore, grant table or other
complex drivers. Some of them are small kernel-space applications (often
called "baremetal", not to be confused with the term "baremetal" used in
datacenter which means "without hypervisors") or RTOSes.  Additionally,
for safety reasons, users often need to be able to configure the full
system statically so that it can be verified statically.

Event channels are very simple and can be added even to baremetal
applications. This proposal introduces a way to define them statically
to make them suitable to dom0less embedded deployments.

There is no need to use two evtchn nodes for this given that in device
tree it is entirely normal to have multiple tuplets in a property. Also,
it would be good to have a version number in the compatible string so
that we can change version in the future.

1)
    chosen {
        ....

        domU1: domU1 {
            ......
        };

        domU2: domU2 {
            ......
        };

        evtchn {
            compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
            xen,evtchn = <0xa &domU1 0xb &domU2 0xc &domU1 0xd &domU2>;
        };
    };


I should mention that it would be also possible to use sub-nodes to
express this information:

2)
        domU1: domU1 {
            ...
            /* one sub-node per local event channel */
            ec1: evtchn@a {
                compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
                /* local-evtchn link-to-foreign-evtchn */
                xen,evtchn = <0xa &ec3>
            };
            ec2: evtchn@c {
                compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
                xen,evtchn = <0xc &ec4>
            };
        };

        domU2: domU2 {
            ...
            ec3: evtchn@b {
                compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
                xen,evtchn = <0xb &ec1>
            };
            ec4: evtchn@d {
                compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
                xen,evtchn = <0xa &ec2>
            };
        };
    };

This format has the advantage that doesn't need a new top-level node
type under /chosen. That is desirable few a few reasons. Today we only
have domains (dom0 is legacy). In the future we might have nested
domains and non-Xen domains. With System Device Tree, domains are under
/domains instead of /chosen.

So normally I would argue to use the sub-node format because it doesn't
need a new top-level node under /chosen. However, in this case it looks
like the 1) format is simpler to write and also simpler to parse in Xen.

In 1), we would need to loop over xen,evtchn and for each tuplet we
would only need to fetch the foreign domid.

In 2), we would need to check the compatible string of every
"xen,evtchn-v1" node, and we would have to fetch from the phandle both
the remote event channel number but also the domain-id of the parent.

So it looks like 1) is better because it is much simpler to parse. Do
you agree?

I think this is fine in principle. Like Jan wrote, at some point we'll
need to specify the device tree binding to expose this information to
the guest.

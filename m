To be honest, Demi has a point. At the moment, VMF is a very niche 
use-case (see more below). So you would end up to use less than 10% of 
the normal Xen on Arm code. A lot of people will likely wonder why using 
Xen in this case?

This suggests a mix of guests are running (some using hypercalls and 
other not). It would not be possible if you were using VMF.

I agree that we have a strong focus on making Xen more secure. However, 
we also need to look at the use cases for it. As it stands, there will no:
   - IOREQ use (don't think about emulating TPM)
   - GICv3 ITS
   - stage-1 SMMUv3
   - decoding of instructions when there is no syndrome
   - hypercalls (including event channels)
   - dom0

That's a lot of Xen features that can't be used. Effectively you will 
make Xen more "secure" for a very few users.

I disagree, I think this is also about use cases. On the paper VMF look 
very great, but so far it still has a big flaw (the TTBR can be changed) 
and it would restrict a lot what you can do.

To me, if you can't secure the TTBR, then there are other way to improve 
the security of Xen for the same setup and more.

The biggest attack surface of Xen on Arm today are the hypercalls. So if 
you remove hypercalls access to the guest (or even compile out), then 
there is a lot less chance for an attacker to compromise Xen.

This is not exactly the same guarantee as VMF. But as I wrote before, if 
the attacker has access to Xen, then you are already doomed because you 
have to assume they can switch the TTBR.

Cheers,

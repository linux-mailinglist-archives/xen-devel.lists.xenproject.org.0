Thank you for the suggestion on the second option, I think that is
close to what we intended. Let me add a few more details.

There has been a significant trend toward using virtio for all virtual
interfaces in automotive and other industries for several years now.
While I'm not entirely sure about Windows, all the operating systems we
work with (e.g. Android, RTOSes) are optimizing for virtio interfaces.
The expectation is that guests will either access physical devices or
virtio devices. I mention this in response to the specialized vs.
general approach - virtio is becoming (or has already become) the
standard, at least in automotive and embedded sectors. This is why we
have introduced the new specialized QEMU machine for virtio only on both
ARM and x86. However, you are right that the solution is somewhat
dependent on the QEMU emulation provided, meaning it isn't fully
generalized and may not work with other device models. Let's see if we
can improve this. 

I agree that a single PCI root complex is the cleanest solution from a
Xen perspective. However, aside from the level of effort required, it's
also important to consider QEMU integration. The separate root complex
integrates very well into QEMU's own view of the world, and that is
important too because the more we deviate the more we are at risk of
triggering unwanted bugs in QEMU. Bugs that would only show up in a Xen
configuration and we would responsible to fix. The two PCI RCs approach
is simple because it is low complexity from a QEMU point of view. The
trade-off is having the two PCI RCs exposed to the VM instead of one,
but in our tests two PCI RCs work well on both ARM and even x86. So I
think the two PCI RCs approach is viable. (Also I believe that
technically is a single PCI RC with two host bridges.)

For the second option, I'll let Edgar investigate but I think that would
work, thank you for being flexible. We would still need patches 4-6 from
this series.

Let's assume we'll proceed with patches 4-6 and, as agreed, skip patches
1-2. Then my first thought would be to rely on ImageBuilder to generate
the complete virtio DT node. While I usually like using ImageBuilder,
in this case, I lean toward having Xen generate the domU nodes. There
are a few reasons for this: the partial DTB is typically used for
passthrough and related information, which isn't the case here. Although
ImageBuilder can merge multiple partial DTBs, I think it's best not to
depend on that more delicate feature, for scenarios where a user wants
both a passthrough device and a virtio device.

But we could change the DT properties to be more explicitly related to
an emulated PCI root complex, which could be provided by any device
model and not only QEMU. Also we can avoid saying "virtio" in the
property name because although our use-case is virtio, as you wrote
there is nothing that ties this to virtio today. So what about the
following dom0less device tree properties instead?

secondary-emulated-pci-host-bridge = <ecam_address ecam_size
                                      memory_address memory_size
                                      prefetch_address prefetch_size
                                      irq_start, irq_how_many,
                                      flags>;
one of the special flags could be grants enabled/disabled.

This way:

- The list of interrupts and MMIOs is explicit
- The fact that we are talking about a seconday emulated host bridge is
  explicit, in the description we can say we expect it to be provided by
  an ioreq device model. We can call it secondary-ioreq-pci-host-bridge
- The Xen-generated domU device tree description is still generic and
  reusable. Let's say that someone comes up with a different use-case
  and a different device model but still wants a PCI host bridge, they
  can reuse this. The DomU DT is standard for a generic PCI host bridge.
- We don't need ImageBuilder to generate/edit complex device tree nodes
  and merge partial device trees

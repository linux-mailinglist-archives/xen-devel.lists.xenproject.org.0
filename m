What about tools/fuzz then? This is where are all the tooling for the 
fuzzing.

It is unclear to me what is left from that "existing" build.sh. At least 
everything below seems to be Xen specific.

Anyway, if you want to give the copyright to Google then fair enough, 
but I think you want to use an Origin tag (or similar) to indicate the 
original copy.

Ok. Can you add a link to the documentation in build.sh? This would be 
helpful for the future reader to understand what's $OUT really mean.

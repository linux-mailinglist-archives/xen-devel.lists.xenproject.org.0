Right, but then we'd need to see the beginning of the trace,
rather than it starting at (in this case) about 95,000. Yet ...

... hmm, odd - no change at all:

95572 hvm_gsi_assert irq 34 trig 1 assert count 1

I was sort of expecting that this might be where we fail to
set the assert count back to zero. Will need further
thinking, if nothing else than how to turn down the verbosity
without hiding crucial information. Or maybe Roger has got
some idea ...

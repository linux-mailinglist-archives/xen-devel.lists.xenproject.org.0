I understand this is the easiest solution... However, this requires code 
in Xen that I am not yet convinced it is good to have.

I am not too concerned about the MMIO range part. This can be (easily) 
solved. I am more concerned about the support of background region and 
the fact the OS needs to be able to rescan.

I am definitely not an expert of PCI, but AFAIK, it is possible to have 
the guest to be notified when a PCI device is hotplug. Why can't we use it?

To me this raises the question why we should have a temporary solution 
upstream then?

It is not clear how I should read this answer... If you add SB in 
cpuerrata.c, then a user will start to see message like:

"enabled workaround for Speculation Barrier".

Which is completely bogus. Replacing "dsb; isb" with "sb" is mostly an 
optimization and none of the current use will end up to be 
architecturaly executed.

I appreciate this is more work to add cpufeature.c. However, AFAIK, 
there are no rush to get this optimization in (see why above) and muddy 
(even temporarily) the logs.

Cheers,

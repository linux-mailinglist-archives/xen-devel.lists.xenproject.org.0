May I ask that along with dom0less you also explain the (non-)relationship
to the late-Dom0 model we've been having for a number of years? Some
aspects of what the boot domain does look, to me, quite similar.

Apart from this one immediate detail I'm curious about (and that I also
don't know/recall how it gets handled with dom0less): Death of Dom0 in a
traditional setup is a signal to Xen to reboot the host. With any of the
boot time created domains not functioning anymore, the intended purpose
of the host may no longer be fulfilled. But of course there may be a
subset of "optional" domains. As a result - are there any intentions
towards identifying under what conditions it may be better to reboot the
host than wait for human interaction?

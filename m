To me your text doesn't make it clear that you only talk about 64-bit
guests there. Talking about 32-bit user space doesn't imply a 64-bit
kernel to me.

Yet how does this make anyone looking think of this being a 64-bit
entry then?

As to CS vs SS - I think the canonical CPL is SS.DPL, and since
for SS DPL == RPL, also SS.RPL. At least that's what we use in a
number of places.

The problem here is once again the lack of documentation of the ABI.
As such, the behavior of the implementation, of however good or bad
intent, has been the reference. And hence I don't see us changing the
behavior as a viable thing.

If you can get e.g. Roger to support your position and provide an
ack to this change, I guess I'm willing to accept the change going in
as it is. But I'm afraid I can't give it my R-b.

Well, that's the part of the change that we look to agree to make. Our
disagreement is merely about what is to happen when only a 64-bit
entry point gets registered. I was wondering whether you wouldn't be
willing to split the change, so that the uncontroversial part can go
in. But I do realize that's extra work on your part, which
- considering the position you take - you may view as pointless effort.

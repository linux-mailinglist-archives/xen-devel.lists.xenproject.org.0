As an outsider's perspective, I think this kind of thing is where selftests
really shine.  I got the impression that Xen will need to rely on numerous other
platform oddities, the documentation of which are often unavailable.

Of course, adding a whole new test infrastructure in code freeze is not viable.
Maybe I have missed something, but I only see three paths forward here:

1. Reference the most relevant paragraph in SDM/APM, but don't quote it.
   Keep the current explanation, and state that the manual is vague anyway.

2. Acknowledge that SDM/APM is incomplete, and completely abandon the manual
   as the *authoritative* source of information.  Perhaps embed a sample test
   program that demonstrates the behavior, if it isn't too long.

3. Actually assert in runtime that DR6 behaves as expected.

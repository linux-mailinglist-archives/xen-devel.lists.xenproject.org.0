I read this as there might be MPU system with SMMU in development. What 
you want to explain is why we can't let the developper to select the 
SMMU driver on an MPU system.

 From my understanding this is because the drivers are expecting to use 
the page-tables and the concept doesn't exist in the MPU system. So the 
drivers are not ready for the MPU.

I think it should be a replacement because none of the IOMMU drivers 
works for the MPU. So I would rather prefer if we avoid adding "depends 
on" on all of them (even if there are only 3) for now.

Did you confirm that Xen MPU still build without HAS_PASSTHROUGH?

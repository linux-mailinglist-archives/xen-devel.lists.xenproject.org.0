Not sure what you mean with "no-op" here. It's not like the
mask values would all be the same.

I can certainly do this, but it very much seems to me to be a
request you'd call "scope creep". I was meaning to address the
issue at hand with a minimally invasive change. The bigger
variant you suggest is unlikely to cause backporting issues,
yes, but still ... Anyway, I'll do as you ask, to cut the
discussion short.

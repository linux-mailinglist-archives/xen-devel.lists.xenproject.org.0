First, let's recognize that we have two opposing requirements. One
requirement is to make it as easy as possible to configure for the user.
Ideally without using negative CONFIG options, such as
NO_PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE. From the user point of view, honestly,
PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE is a pretty good name. Better than all of the others,
I think.

On the other hand, we have the requirement that we don't want
allyesconfig to end up disabling a bunch of CONFIG options. Now this
requirement can be satisfied easily by adding something like
NO_PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE. However, it would go somewhat against the previous
requirement.

So we need a compromise, something that doesn't end up disabling other
CONFIG options, to make allyesconfig happy, but also not too confusing
for the user (which is a matter of personal opinion).

In short, expect that people will have different opinions on this and
will find different compromises better or worse. For one, I prefer to
compromise on "no negative CONFIG options" and use
PV_SHIM_NOT_EXCLUSIVE. Because it serves the allyesconfig goal, and
while it is not as clear as PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE, is still better than a
completely generic FULL_HYPERVISOR option, which means nothing to me.

I cannot see a way to have a good and clear non-negated CONFIG option,
and also satisfy the allyesconfig requirement. So I prefer to compromise
on the "non-negated" part.

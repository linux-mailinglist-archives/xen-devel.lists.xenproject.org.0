The AMD-Vi specification mentions the following regarding the
interrupt address range:

Which I interpret in the same way as VT-d: input addresses that belong
to the interrupt address range are not subject to translation.  Output
addresses that belong to the interrupt address range are not allowed,
otherwise the IOMMU will raise a fault.

I've added the following chunk to Xen:

diff --git a/xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/iommu.c b/xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/iommu.c
index 8b1e0596b84a..20aa46e305a3 100644
--- a/xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/iommu.c
+++ b/xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/iommu.c
@@ -480,6 +480,9 @@ void __hwdom_init arch_iommu_hwdom_init(struct domain *d)
     if ( rc )
         panic("IOMMU failed to remove Interrupt Address Range: %d\n", rc);
 
+    rc = rangeset_add_range(map, 0xfee01, 0xfeeff);
+    BUG_ON(rc);
+
     /* If emulating IO-APIC(s) make sure the base address is unmapped. */
     if ( has_vioapic(d) )
     {

And run a basic test on each server microarchitecture (AMD Naples to
Genoa, Intel Haswell to Emerald Rapids) available on XenRT, everything
seems to be OK, no IOMMU faults, but still running.

Would you agree to allowing mappings to the interrupt address range if
the above test raises no issues?  I know it's not every possible piece
of hardware out there, but it's quite good coverage.

IMO Xen should allow the creation of mappings on the interrupt address
range, otherwise I don't see how we can deal with Thinkpad issue.  And
this issue we known about, but sadly we have no visibility of what
firmware might put in that range.

Thanks, Roger.

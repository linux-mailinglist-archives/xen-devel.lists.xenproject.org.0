How do you derive that meaning? The bit tells us whether in the
individual fixed range MTRR bytes bits 3 and 4 have an AMD-
specific meaning. Guests reading these will get back zero for
the bits in all cases right now, and hence the meaning would be
"MMIO" for all of them, despite there being some RAM ranges
covered as well. Imo the bit needs to be zero to be compatible
with the rest of our code.

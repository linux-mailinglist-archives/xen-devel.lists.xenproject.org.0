Right - we only have an almost-rule for new code.

Well, we could formalize the (or ideally: some) naming model to
distinguish the cases. Question then is going to be in how many
cases neither contributor nor reviewers are(n't) going to pay
attention.

Exactly, so unilaterally going the "don't copy and hence don't
require zero" route is not an option imo.

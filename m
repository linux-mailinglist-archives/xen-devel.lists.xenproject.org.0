Indeed, p2m types are just occasionally faked for PV, like in
get_page_from_gfn().

OK.  I'm kind of surprised we need foreign handling for HVM and not
for PV in get_page_from_gfn(), as even with specific handling of
foreign pages in get_page_from_l1e(), the former is used in a lot of
places that don't seem obviously tied or gated to a call to
get_page_from_l1e().

For example the XEN_DOMCTL_getpageframeinfo3 usage of
get_page_from_gfn() will have different results when used against a
foreign page depending on whether the caller is a PV or an HVM
domain.

Thanks, Roger.

IOW the breakage from the other patch was because rubbish was
written first, and suitable data was written later on? I didn't
think core PCI code in Linux would do such, which would make me
suspect a driver having custom MSI handling code ...

Am I understanding correctly that this change is independent of
the initial 2 patches (where I have reservations), and hence
it could go in ahead of them (or all alone)?

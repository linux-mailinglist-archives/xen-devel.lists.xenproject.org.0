Hi George,

Thanks for the summary! A couple of comments below.

The new contribution here could be code imported from Linux that would 
be GPLv2-only in GPLv2-or-later file. It is not clear to me what would 
be the legal implication.

There is that and also the fact that we now need to be more careful when 
importing code from Linux. In Shawn's case this is mitigated by the fact 
that the license in Xen files should match the one in Linux.

+1. Do you think that would be a good topic for Xen Summit?

Hi Jason,

yes, thank you thats it!

Though to be fair, i did cross post on xen-users because i got 
impatient. I tried to post here and didnt get activated on xen-devel but 
also did not get any feedback from the maillinglist server about my 
initial post. So i signed up for xen-users.
Then i found a solution but didnt understand it and posted my findings 
their.

It does report about missing tun interface on dom0, but i missed to look 
at the log-files completely. Interesting the tun interface is not 
necessary on netbackend. But i think it would be, if i have to use the 
emulated type, maybe i need it later.

That's the thing, i did see that the type=vif does something different 
in the documentation but i did not understand what the differences are. 
So because i now know something more. It makes sense and thanks for the 
clarification.

Why? The entry could be re-used to map the devices entry.

Internal is in silicon (e.g. real) or virtual platform?

Can you list the 7 sections? Is it including the init section?

The section I am the most concern of is mpu,device-memory-section 
because it would likely mean that all the devices will be mapped in Xen. 
Is there any risk that the guest may use different memory attribute?

On the platform you are describing, what are the devices you are 
expected to be used by Xen?

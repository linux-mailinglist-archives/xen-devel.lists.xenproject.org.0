No problem for both: Given the earlier remarks by Julien on patch 1/4, I 
think we can devise something along the lines of

/* SAF-x-safe MISRA:C 2012 Rule 9.1 <Justification> */
int var;

and then write a generic justification in docs/misra/safe.json, while
<Justification> contains a specific one (e.g., this loop does so and so 
to ensure that no access to unset variables happens). Thus any 
modification to that variable would give who submits the patch and the 
reviewer a chance to spot any inconsistency when the code is modified.

However, given my other response to this same patch, this does not apply 
here specifically.

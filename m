While I agree this is not useful today, the idea is we can find easily 
what features each processor supports. This could be useful if we wanted 
to expose big.LITTLE to the guest.

For instance, imagine you have a system where some processor may support 
32-bit EL1 only on some processor. With a global approach, we would say 
"32-bit EL1 is not supported". That would prevent a user to use the 
system to its full advantage.

Note that I am not asking to implement such things today... This is more 
to show that we will likely want to keep the per-CPU info around.

The system_cpuinfo could be used for system wide decision in Xen (e.g. 
P2M size, cacheline size....) while the per-CPU could be used to enable 
features only used by a couple of CPUs.

How much are we talking?

This would not be quite the same. You may have a system where not all 
processors have ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.CSV2 is set, yet we want to avoid 
setting the hardening vector on process with the bit set to reduce the 
overhead.

I don't think that all operations on state_entry_time need to be atomic.
Only the bit write to XEN_RUNSTATE_UPDATE. More on this below.

Yes but they are all just readers, right?

I was not suggesting to use an atomic_t type. I was only suggesting to
use an atomic operation, i.e. calling write_u32_atomic directly (or
something like that.) I would not change the type of state_entry_time.
Also using memcpy would be acceptable due to the fact that we only need
to update one byte.

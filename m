First let me clarify that the specification is not mandating that the
module nodes are at a specific depth, from that point of view it is OK
to have "intermediate" nodes. The issue is that "modules" is not
described and doesn't have a compatible string, so we don't know how we
should deal with it.

Although in the device tree specification [1] is not written in clear
letters that a compatible string is mandatory, it written that the
compatible string is necessary for two things:

- identify the driver to use for a device
- specify the "Device Bindings" [2]

The device bindings are the "requirements for how specific types and
classes of devices are represented in the devicetree". Basically, it is
what tells us how to represent and what to do with a given node.

Let's say that we want to group together a bunch of device nodes. We use
a bus node like "amba" to do it. If we don't specify compatible =
"simple-bus" we don't know how to map the addresses of the children
nodes into the parent address space, so the device nodes under "amba"
become actually unusable.

Chosen is for configurations, not for the description of devices.
However, similar rules apply: if we encounter a "modules" node, what are
we going to do with it? Is it OK to proceed and parse the children nodes
as normal? We don't know for sure. Imagine that instead of "modules" one
calls it "disabled" instead. What do we do in that case?

In short, we need a description of "modules" to know what to do with it.
To describe "modules", we need a binding. To have a binding, we need a
compatible string.

That's fine by me

Do you have a link to the Linux tree? Is there any additional patches on 
top of vanilla?

I am slightly confused to how this would help. Xen and, AFAICT, Linux 
don't understand gic-lpi-base. Do you have modification in your Linux to 
use it?

Looking at the DT changes in [0], it looks like the node is not a child 
of gic@. So I think Xen will map the region to Dom0.

There are two things that I can notice:
   1) This region is RAM, but I can't find any reserve node. Is there 
any specific code in Linux to reserve it?
   2) The implementation in U-boot seems to suggest that the firmware 
will configure the LPIs and then enable it. If that's the case, then Xen 
needs to re-use the table in the DT rather than allocating a new one. 
However, I would have expected an error message in the log:

    "GICv3: CPUx: Cannot initialize LPIs"

At least Xen should not expose gic-lpi-base to the kernel, but I will 
wait on more details about the Linux kernel used before commenting more.

I would also be interested to know more details about the failure when 
gic-lpi-base is not added in your DT. In particular, I am interested to 
understand why Xen would not expose the ITS as we don't parse that node.

No worries, debug patches are not meant to be nice to read ;).

0xc is INV and 0x5 is SYNC. Most likely the driver unmask the interrupt 
by writing in the property table (access are not trapped to Xen) and 
then requested to invalidate the cache state.

It is at least a good sign because it means Linux is able to 
initialize/talk to the vITS.

I would lean towards one (or multiple) issue with pITS and/or the 
device-tree exposed to Linux. I am not entirely what exactly... I think 
having more details about the Linux setup would be helpful.

I will reply on Rahul's e-mail separately.

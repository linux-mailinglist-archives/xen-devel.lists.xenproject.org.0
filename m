I'd like to leave it as is; right here it's not overly important what
state the binutils side is. Furthermore, by the time this goes in the
binutils side may have changed state already (e.g. from "open problem" to
"fix in progress").

So one thing we could do is to prefer FUNC/OBJECT symbols over NOTYPE
ones, and only use global-ness as a last resort criteria.

But "prefer" != "strip" in any event.

Stripping section symbols is reasonably easy for ELF, as rather than
being NOTYPE they have no type at all. Stripping section start symbols,
otoh, can only be done by name, and hence we'd need to maintain a list
of them in the symbols tool. Not overly nice, but doable of course.

An intrusive - to the symbol table - alternative may be to simply strip
all NOTYPE symbols. Yet that would take as a prereq marking quite a few
more as FUNC or OBJECT.

We also need to keep in mind the opposite (lookup by name) for livepatch.
I for one have no idea how (un)likely it might be for there to be a need
to lookup a section symbol (then we'd be in trouble with newer binutils)
or a section start symbol.

If we can agree on what behavior we want, I can see about adding further
patches to the series.

I don't consider that commit relevant.

There is no circumstance ever where you can relocate Xen with
actually-overlapping ranges, because one way or another, you'd end up
copying non-pagetable data over the live pagetables.

That particular commit was part of trying to make Xen's entry code
relocatable, so the MB2 path could load Xen at somewhere which wasn't 0,
but to this day we still skip any physical relocation if Xen isn't
started at 0.


To the comment specifically, it's actively wrong.

Back when XEN_IMG_OFFSET was 1M, and we had 16M worth of unconditional
mappings, then we could get PTE overlap as described, in the corner case
where we were moving Xen from 0 to anywhere between 4 and 16M physical
(2M physical was in principle a problem, but not an eligible position to
relocate to, given Xen's compile size).

And in that corner case, the logic would "corrupt" various PTEs by not
relocating them.Â  The PTE coving _start at 1M was special cased ahead of
the 2nd loop (finally fixed last week) and the PTEs mapping beyond _end
were unused which is why nothing actually went wrong.

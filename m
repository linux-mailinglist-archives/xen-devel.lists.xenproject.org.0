No, CF8 is special - partial accesses have no meaning as to the
index selection for subsequent CFC accesses. Or else CF9
couldn't be a standalone port with entirely different
functionality..

Hmm, when choosing the name I decided that (a) it's a helper of
the other function and (b) it's still guest driven data that we
output.

Well, yes, I guess I should. But then if I edit this moved code,
I guess I'll also get rid of the stray casts.

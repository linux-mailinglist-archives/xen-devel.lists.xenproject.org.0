Didn't mention it here, but setup_IO_APIC_irqs() will also perform an
__ioapic_write_entry() call for almost all pins.

That indeed I cannot guarantee, as I don't have coverage figures for
the XenRT runs.

Seeing as there's too much uncertainty about whether the array will be
initialized, I will go back to the approach of having a sentinel.
Andrew suggested to use a 16bit types, would you agree to that or do
you prefer to use unsigned int as originally proposed?

Thanks, Roger.

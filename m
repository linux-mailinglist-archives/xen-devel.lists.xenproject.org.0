All of this and some of your remarks further down has already been
discussed. A working group has been formed. No progress since. Yes,
a smaller set of interfaces may be the way to go. Controlling
behavior via flags, otoh, is very much not malloc()-like. Making
existing functions have the intended new behavior is a no-go without
auditing all present uses, to find those few which actually may need
physically contiguous allocations.

Having seen similar naming elsewhere, I did propose xnew() /
xdelete() (plus array and flex-struct counterparts) as the single
new recommended interface; didn't hear back yet. But we'd switch to
that gradually, so intermediately there would still be a larger set
of interfaces.

I'm not convinced we should continue to have byte-granular allocation
functions producing physically contiguous memory. I think the page
allocator should be used directly in such cases.

As long as xmalloc() and vmalloc() are meant stay around as separate
interfaces, I wouldn't want to "forbid" their use when it's sufficiently
clear that they would be chosen by the new function anyway. Otoh, if the
new function became more powerful in terms of falling back to the
respectively other lower level function, that might be an argument in
favor of always using the new interfaces.

Yes, it would. Personally (see "[PATCH v2 0/8] assorted replacement of
x[mz]alloc_bytes()") I think these ..._bytes() wrappers should all go
away. Hence I don't think it's very important how exactly they behave,
and in turn it's then best to have them match x[mz]alloc_bytes().

Ah yes, will do. Simply a result of taking the other header as basis.

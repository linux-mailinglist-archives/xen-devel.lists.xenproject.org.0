Well, first of all just a couple of patches ago two indirect
calls were folded into one, so it's at least not getting worse
compared to where we started from. And then both HAP and nested
install just one of the two hooks.

As per the remark in an earlier patch, referred to ...

... here, there is the option of doing away with the indirect
calls altogether, but - as said earlier - at the price of at
least coming close to a layering violation.

Only almost, since HAP has

    if ( oflags & _PAGE_PRESENT )
        guest_flush_tlb_mask(d, d->dirty_cpumask);

instead (i.e. they differ in which dirty_cpumask gets used).

Yes, I did, but I don't think the post hook can be moved out. The
only alternative therefore would be a 3rd hook. And this hook would
then need to be installed on the host p2m for nested guests, as
opposed to nestedp2m_write_p2m_entry_post, which gets installed in
the nested p2m-s. As said in the description, the main reason I
decided against a 3rd hook is that I suppose the code here isn't
HAP-specific (while prior to this patch it was).

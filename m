I was wrong here, when it comes to an Arm64 build with ACPI
support enabled. xen/arch/arm/efi/efi-dom0.c has

#define XZ_EXTERN STATIC
#include "../../../common/xz/crc32.c"

in order to later do

    xz_crc32_init();
    efi_sys_tbl->Hdr.CRC32 = xz_crc32((uint8_t *)efi_sys_tbl,
                                      efi_sys_tbl->Hdr.HeaderSize, 0);

Urgh. Why in the world does xz code get re-used like this?
If we need generic crc32 support, such should imo live in
xen/lib/.

So we have two possible courses of action: Eliminate this
unsuitable re-use of code, or introduce asm/unaligned.h
for Arm (or at least Arm64, in case it makes a difference)
right away.

Julien, Stefano?

Thanks, Jan

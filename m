Hm, it's kind of complicated (I'm not saying it's impossible).  I
think it will require renaming the replaced function symbols, and then
introducing new unresolved symbols that reference the existing
functions, and adjusting the relocations to point to those new
symbols.

Then Xen would resolve those symbols and the relocations would be
calculated using the old addresses.

You can not unconditionally replace all the relocations that point to
replacement symbols, as some of the relocations will need to point to
new vs old instances (just as this patch does, where not all
relocations are adjusted to point to the old addresses).

I can give it a try, but looks more complicated than the approach
here, as it requires crafting extra symbols to add to the payload, and
adjust relocations.

Indeed, storing pointers to newly introduced functions won't work,
that needs care, but it should be easier to spot by code review of the
livepatch.  Would be nice to get an automated way to prevent such
pointers from getting stored, but I can't think of a way to do it.

Thanks, Roger.

I've not observed problematic wrmsr_safe() so far.

Especially if Andrew's ambiguous objection was against the write side
only, I think I'd prefer to go with this latter variant. Considering
that dealing with the read side alone is sufficient to address the
observed issue, I'm even inclined to prefer this irrespective of that
constraint.

You didn't, indeed, but "those two" is slightly confusing, the two
links Roger did provide are just different versions of the same
patch. Hence I'd like to double check that it is exactly this one
patch of mine (of which I need to send another version, at least
to include Roger's requested documentation of the behavior, and
possibly also the write side equivalent - still waiting for Andrew
to come back and clarify the scope of his objection).

The question is here - we aren't sure yet that this is the only
one, are we? Andrew suspects if this one MSR gets accessed this
way, then likely others will be, too. Boris, can you tell for sure
either way?

Also, Boris - any chance you could give your Tested-by for Roger's
patch? It's otherwise ready to go in, but I'd prefer to commit it
knowing that you've tested this hopefully final version. I'm sorry
for the recurring requests to test this workaround.

Yes. It claiming a firmware bug when running under Xen, but not when
running natively is likely to cause support calls.

... would crash. I should say though that with increasing awareness of
potentially running virtualized, kernels have become more careful in
this regard. (I was about to say "with implications like this one, but
since you say "imply" was wrong, "implications" would likely be as well.
What would the correct noun here be then? My dictionary has "inference",
but this feels a little odd, too much like misspelled "interference".)

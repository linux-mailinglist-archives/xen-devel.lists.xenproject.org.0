Oh, right - a re-basing oversight. Thanks for noticing. (It's not
just the registration that's missing, but also the avoiding of it
in case ACPI_FADT_NO_CMOS_RTC is set.)

Just like the other RTC registers - their contents may change behind
our backs, here e.g. over New Year between two centuries.

Well - I'm not modifying what d points to. In principle these I/O
bitmaps are shared; It's just Dom0 which gets a separate one. So
modifying the bitmap really is unrelated to modifying struct domain.

Long ago we agreed to avoid BUG_ON() with expressions that have
required (side) effects. I.e. just like for ASSERT(), where the
expression wouldn't get evaluated at all when NDEBUG is defined.

I'm afraid I don't see the connection of this remark to the
construct in question.

Whether the EFI runtime services use the RTC is unknown. There are
specific precautions towards this in the UEFI spec, iirc.

Bit 7 in port 70 has a different meaning (NMI mask); you can access
RTC/CMOS bytes 0-127 only this way. There are chipsets which provide
256-byte CMOS, where the high half can be accessed via the aliases.

However, seeing this comment of yours I noticed that there's still a
related bug here: When the guest reads/writes the index port, I _also_
need to mask off the high bit when it's the non-aliased port that gets
accessed. Otherwise Dom0 writing port 74 but then reading port 71
could lead to bit 7 getting set in port 70.

FWIW, I'm thinking that I want to move x2apic_ldr_from_id() to a
header file, so that it can also be used by the native APIC driver in
order to detect when the LDR field is not configured according to the
spec (so adding a consistency check in
init_apic_ldr_x2apic_cluster()).

Anyway, might look into doing that after this patch is in.

Sounds good.  And I agree that using {GET,SET}_xAPIC_ID() on the
x2APIC 32bit width IDs looks to be wrong.

Yes, there's plenty of padding but I feel it's better to place it with
the rest of the booleans, as there's also padding there.

OK, if you think mentioning `bug` is helpful, I think it would be best
placed as a prefix: bug_x2apic_ldr_vcpu_id.  Having it in the middle
of the field name makes it harder to spot.

Thanks, Roger.

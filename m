I am not sure I would call it difficulties yet. I would say it is more 
that I haven't looked too much in the spec to understand if there is a 
trivial way to distinguish between v7 and v8.

Maybe AndrÃ© or Bertrand can help here?

Nothing in the Armv8 say the register is optional. So we technically 
cannot return "not implemented".

However, we could consider to return "not implemented" (which would 
likely result to a crash) if we are not confident with the fixed value 
returned.

Right, at the same time we don't want to introduce problem hard to 
diagnostic.

This is quite similar to the discussion about IS{ACT,PEND}R GIC register 
we had in the past. If we return dummy value, then the guest may 
continue to run until a point but we don't know for how long. An error 
may come up a really long time after and it would be difficult to find 
the exact root cause.

So we need to be careful in our choice.

I agree that we should return 0, but I disagree with the justification 
(see more below).

Reading the Armv8 spec again, 0 means there is no support for 
miscellaneous features. So the guest should behave correctly if we 
return 0. Therefore returning 0 for AArch32 should be fine.

The most important things here is to not shoot ourself in the foot by 
returning value we don't understand :). It is best to crash the guest 
rather than continuing until it become nearly impossible to track the 
root cause of an issue.

I made this suggestion because I originally thought it would not be 
possible to find a sensible value. I believe we found one, so this 
suggestion can be discarded.

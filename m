I can't really speak for x86. However, for Arm, I think it could be 
useful in the case there is a system where the frametable size doesn't 
change with CONFIG_PDX=n and/or the integrator is happy to waste a bit 
more memory to gain performance.

Also, to reply to Jan's, I don't think this is a sort of option that 
should be gated by expert (againt at least on Arm). Xen ought to work 
fine with and without PDX enabled. From my understanding, the only 
differences are the amount of memory wasted vs performance gain.

Cheers,

Thanks. To clarify, shall I add it in each patch or only this one?

While there is no ISB directly after DSB NSH, there are one right after 
MSR. I don't think we need one before because nothing will use the TLBs 
between before the ISB.

         /*
          * The state of the TLBs is unknown before turning on the MMU.
          * Flush them to avoid stale one.
          */
         tlbi  alle2                  /* Flush hypervisor TLBs */
         dsb   nsh

         /* Write Xen's PT's paddr into TTBR0_EL2 */
         load_paddr x0, boot_pgtable
         msr   TTBR0_EL2, x0
         isb

That would be good. But I don't think this is necessary here (see above).

We only throw away our mapping. The memory belongs to the guest and it
should ensure it does not submit requests after the state has left
'connected'

What about a malicious guest that is piling requests into the ring. It 
could keep us in the loop forever, couldn't it?

Sorry, I was referring to the need to do aio_context_acquire() calls but 
they are only around the disputed xen_block_handle_requests() call 
anyway, so there's no simplification in this bit.

Ok, I had assumed that the issue was the context being picked up inside 
the xen_block_complete_aio() call.

So if you drop the ring drain then this patch should still stop the 
SEGVs, right?

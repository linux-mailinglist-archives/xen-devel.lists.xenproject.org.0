I thought about it but I couldn't come up with a way to do that which
retains the simplicity of this example. The problem is that in device
tree you can only link to nodes, not to individual properties. So I
think we would have to have separate nodes for each event channel so
that we could separately link to them. 

Otherwise, we would have to add the foreign event channel number in
addition to the link to be able to distinguish them. And that would
result in duplicated information. E.g.:

       domU1: domU1 {
           ...
           /* one sub-node per local event channel */
           ec1: evtchn@a {
               compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
               /* local-evtchn link-to-foreign foreign-evtchn */
               xen,evtchn = <0xa &ec2 0xa 0xc &ec2 0xd>
           };
       };

       domU2: domU2 {
           ...
           ec2: evtchn@b {
               compatible = "xen,evtchn-v1";
               xen,evtchn = <0xb &ec1 0xa 0xd &ec1 0xc>
           };
       };

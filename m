Actually I realize now that earlier I said I'm okay with this going in
if Roger acks it. I take it that Roger was aware of the controversy
when providing the ack. Therefore I'd like to take back what I've said
above, and your supposed v3 ought to be okay to get committed.

As to backporting - I'd surely be taking the split off part here, but
I have to admit I'm hesitant to take the full change. IOW splitting
the two changes might still be a helpful thing.

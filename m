Ok.

Uhh, I simply forgot that PVH also constructs e820 - it seems it's doing it
properly though. I want to makes e820 map as close as possible between PVH and
HVM - let me see if I can improve my HVM version.

It's possible that there is something in between. IGD opregion is allocated
dynamically from above and occupies a couple of pages - there is a gap between the
top of a populated region and it where other structures could be located.
I don't want to tie e820 to the current allocation order.

Ok, I'll see if I keep this function in a new version.

Andrew, thank you so much for pointing this out.

I think the idea was that we can specify the individual users with
access to protected branches. We cannot add restrictions for unprotected
branches. So if we set the gitlab runner to only run protected jobs,
then the $CI_COMMIT_REF_PROTECTED check makes sense. Not for security,
but to prevent the jobs from getting stuck waiting for a runner that
will never arrive.

However, like Marek said, now the gitlab runners don't have the
"Protected" check set, so it is all useless :-(

I would prefer to set "Protected" in the gitlab runners settings so that
it becomes easier to specify users that can and cannot trigger the jobs.

Then, we'll need the $CI_COMMIT_REF_PROTECTED check, not for security,
but to avoid pipelines getting stuck for unprotected branches.

It is really difficult to restrict users from triggering jobs in other
way because they are all automatically added to all subprojects.


Would you guys be OK if I set "Protected" in the Xilinx and Qubes gitlab
runners as soon as possible?

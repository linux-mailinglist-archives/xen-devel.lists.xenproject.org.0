Right, I'm not going into these details (or else binding would also
need mentioning) here, as the code comment update should sufficiently
cover it. Hence just saying "sufficient guarantees".

It is effectively only describing how things are (or were before
XSA-343, getting restored here).

Would be nice, but (a) see the last sentence of the comment still
in context above and (b) it shouldn't be just set_pending(). The
comment starts with "All hooks ..." after all.

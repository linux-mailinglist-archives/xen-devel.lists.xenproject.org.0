> If going down this path, there should be one, authoritative, in-tree definition of feature-level support from which Kconfig (build-time policy enforcement) and SUPPORT.md (documentation) can be derived.  Later, even run-time enforcement can be similarly classified.  FuSA may also wish for documented policy to align with enforcement.

The goal is trying to align Kconfig and SUPPORT.md by clarifying the
EXPERT option, which today is a poor implementation of "experimental".

There could be further improvements down the line, for instance we could
taint Xen when UNSUPPORTED is selected and even have separate kconfig
options for UNSUPPORTED, EXPERIMENTAL, and TECHPREVIEW. FuSa is likely
going to need its own SAFETY option too. Like you suggested, we could
even have a single source of feature-level support information for both
Kconfig and SUPPORT.md.

However, I didn't want to increase the scope of this one patch. For now,
it would be a good start if we replaced EXPERT with something that covers
anything not security supported, for which UNSUPPORTED looks like a good
name.

All understood, but it wants justifying like that in the description,
and the discrepancy to the fixed dest mode wants taking care of
(either again verbally, or by a code change).

Well, yes, agreed.

I agree from an abstract perspective. But at the same time I fear
hard to understand / debug regressions. I'd be curious to know what
others think ...

Hi Roger,

The revised patch looks good.  The PBA writes seen during ioatdma driver
initialization (self-test) complete successfully and the driver doesn't complain
(I see two interrupts per ioatdma device).   The driver has a self-test feature
which appears to exercise MSIX interrupts and has code which appears to cause a
PBA write.

Feel free to add "Tested-by: Alex.Olson@starlab.io" to your patchset.

Thanks also for the pointer to your 2018 work on SR-IOV, I'll give it a try. 


FYI, with this patch,  I was seeing  msix_read() and msix_write() being called
during the driver's self-test on physical address 0xfbc01800, corresponding to
the beginning of the PBA (lspci excerpt below):


02:00.0 System peripheral: Intel Corporation Xeon Processor D Family QuickData Technology Register DMA Channel 0
...
        Region 0: Memory at fbc06000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8K]
...
        Capabilities: [ac] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=1 Masked-
                Vector table: BAR=0 offset=00001000
                PBA: BAR=0 offset=00001800
...
        Kernel modules: ioatdma



The functions involved on the Linux kernel side are:

ioat_probe()
 -> ioat3_dma_self_test()
  -> ioat_dma_self_test()
   -> ioat_free_chan_resources()
    ->  ioat_reset_hw()

drivers/dma/ioat/dma.c:   ioat_reset_hw()
...
    ioat_dma->msixpba = readq(ioat_dma->reg_base + 0x1800);
...
    writeq(ioat_dma->msixpba, ioat_dma->reg_base + 0x1800);


Thanks,

-Alex

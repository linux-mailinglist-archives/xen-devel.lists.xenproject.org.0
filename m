I got your point. I think, I am not the right person to judge whether 
the Xen on Arm needs / wants complete M2P support or not (this is a 
question to the maintainers and the community),
but I can't recollect a strong desire or critical need for implementing 
it every time such discussion arose and IIRC only arguments against it. 
Also this activity is not in my list of priorities to do on Xen on Arm. 
But, I agree that having M2P would prevent this (with grant table) and 
similar situations. So, I will add more justification / explanation for 
the current patch.

Now I see that comment is not precise. Probably I should have written 
that "60-bit(28-bit) field is used to store the GFN ..."

ok, thank you. Yes, I checked that (on Arm). I could find only one place 
which would need updating, which was the share_xen_page_with_guest().

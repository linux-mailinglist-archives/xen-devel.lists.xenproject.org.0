But in such a case the "type" field of leaf 0xb's first sub-leaf is
going to be non-zero, isn't it?

Not sure I follow - I'm likely confused by you quoting 0x40000000
and 0x40000100 rather than 0x400000nn and 0x400001nn, as elsewhere
you suggested we may not want to clip sub-leaves there. Can you
clarify whether you really mean only the first sub-leaves (each)
here, and if so why you say "up to"? Furthermore for the Xen leaves
I don't think I do excessive clipping ...

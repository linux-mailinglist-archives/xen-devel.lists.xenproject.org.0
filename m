Yes, it could, and hence it's not really best effort only, but
said retry upon guest mode switch had been added years ago.
(This was one of the things overlooked when x86-64 support was
introduced, as x86-32 doesn't have this same problem.) The
updating is best-effort only as far as a misbehaving guest goes;
in all other aspects it's reliable, assuming that vCPU's only
look at their own data for the purpose of making decisions
(logging and alike are of course still fine, as long as people
are aware of the data possibly being stale).

Hence my request to preferably first settle on a model, such
that the change here could be simply the first step on that
journey.

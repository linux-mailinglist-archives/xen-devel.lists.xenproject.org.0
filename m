So if I understand this right, your response was only indirectly
related to what I said: You mean that no matter whether we find
a way to store full-width GFNs, SH_L1E_MMIO_MAGIC can't have
arbitrarily many set bits dropped. On L1TF vulnerable hardware,
that is (i.e. in principle the constant could become a variable
to be determined at boot).

That's 64G (36 address bits), isn't it? Looking at
l1tf_calculations(), I'd be worried in particular Penryn /
Dunnington might not support more than 36 address bits (I don't
think I have anywhere to check). Even if it was 38, 39, or 40
bits, 64G becomes a not insignificant part of the overall 256G /
512G / 1T address space. Then again the top quarter assumption
in l1tf_calculations() would still be met in this latter case.

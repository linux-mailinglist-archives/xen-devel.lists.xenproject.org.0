Thanks for the links !
 From "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing#Computer_era" :
- "text-editing [...] in Emacs by default uses a double space following 
a period"
- "Troff uses two spaces to mark the end of a sentence"

I guess we at least know why ? :) Many man pages (not only Xen's) use 
double spaces. I just copied the format, good to know it's not 
mandatory. Let's save disk space, one space at a time.

(For fun, another quote from wiki : "Varying the spacing between 
sentences, and using the changing spacing to encode information, are a 
standard method of steganography, hiding secret information in public 
documents", so ... what are you doing guys ? ^^).

Ok, nevermind then.
By the way, are "raw text" files (*.txt) still accepted as docs ?

Ok, will rephrase ! Although I'd have agreed you'd do such changes while 
committing, you better know the terminology than me ! ;)

I also wanted to "normalize" the shutdown statuses between 'xl list' and 
'xl top'. I mainly use (and dev a bit in) xentop, and realized the 
shutdown statuses are not shown (only "s", not "sX").

I'm not sure if you have seen my other patch "Add suspend-to-ram to xl" 
(posted 29 february, no answers yet).
It allows for a domain to be suspended from dom0, without systemd, using 
libxl. Libvirt can do this, and Qubes is using it to suspend domUs 
before suspending dom0.
It works, and better than pause/unpause for the domU, but there's a bug 
later, the domains don't get "destroy"ed after a correct shutdown, need 
to 'xl destroy' manually. I talked a bit about that on XenDevel, but 
didn't get a correct answer, so the patch is stalled ...

Anyways, "ss" would be seen in both cases, if I correctly read the code 
Roger showed me (I cannot use live migration) there is only one 
"suspend" reason.

Meanwhile, will provide v3 !

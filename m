I need the/an interrupt to wake the VCPU from HLT state if we went to 
sleep.

Why would an interrupt be injected here? Doesn't the immediately 
preceding
"cli" disable that?

Or perhaps I need to do a PV/HVM hybrid and set vi->evtchn_upcall_mask 
just
before the cli, and clear it after the sti?

Thanks for the suggestion. This brings us full-circle -- I found [1] and
[2] way back from 2013 when Mirage/Xen was initially using SCHEDOP_poll
and then switched to the current interrupts + SCHEDOP_block approach.

Part of the motivation for the change at the time was to allow waiting
on/servicing more than 128 ports (the limit for SCHEDOP_poll). I doubt
anyone wants to do that these days, but it still makes me a bit 
reluctant
to change back to SCHEDOP_poll.

Indeed and this is exactly the operation I need in the HVM world with 
the
current model.

... well, I don't want to use SCHEDOP_block anyway since that is not 
possible
on ARM, and I would like to keep the code at least "portable with not 
too
much effort". So there should be a non-racy "HVM way" to do this?

I can see that now. The interactions between the "virtual hardware"
(interrupt delivery, VCPU IF) and "PV" parts (event delivery, masking) 
are
hard to understand for me, yet the two are intertwined in the way HVM
works :-(

Coming back to your earlier suggestion of moving the event demuxing (but 
not
the handling) into the upcall interrupt handler itself, perhaps that 
approach
is still worth investigating in combination with re-working the OCaml 
side array
view of pending events, or at least ensuring that atomic operations are 
used
since it would now be updated asynchronously.

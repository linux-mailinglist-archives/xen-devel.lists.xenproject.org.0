I beg to disagree, not that you could have, but that you should have. 
This is now the second XSM issue, that I am aware of at least, that 
myself and the XSM reviewers have been left out of. How and where the 
XSM hooks are deployed are critical to how XSM function, regardless of 
how mundane the change may be. By your logic, as the XSM maintainer I 
can make changes to the XSM code that changes how the system behaves for 
x86 and claim you have no Ack/Nack authority since it is XSM code. These 
subsystems are symbiotic, and we owe each other the due respect to 
include to the other when these systems touch or influence each other.

I will comment on Jurgen's patch.

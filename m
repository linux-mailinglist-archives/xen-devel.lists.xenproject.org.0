They likely don't.

Logical delivery for xAPIC only works in a tiny fraction of cases
(assuming correct topology information, which we don't give), and
persuading a VM to turn on x2APIC without a vIOMMU is not something
we've managed to do in Xen.

Also (as I learn talking to people just last night) it turns out that
Logical Destination Mode for external interrupts is entirely broken
anyway.Â  It always hits the lowest ID in the cluster, unless the LAPIC
in question is already servicing a same-or-higher priority interrupt at
which point the next ID in the cluster is tried.

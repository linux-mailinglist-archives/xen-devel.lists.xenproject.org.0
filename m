I've added:

"As part of the fix r/o MMIO accesses are now handled by
handle_mmio_with_translation(), re-using the same logic that was used
for other read-only types part of p2m_is_discard_write().  The page
present check is dropped as type p2m_mmio_direct must have the
present bit set in the PTE."

Let me know if you think that's enough.

How was access to MMIO r/o regions supposed to be handled before
33c19df9a5a0 (~2015)?  I see that setting r/o MMIO p2m entries was
added way before to p2m_type_to_flags() and ept_p2m_type_to_flags()
(~2010), yet I can't figure out how writes would be handled back then
that didn't result in a p2m fault and crashing of the domain.

I'm happy to look at other ways to handling this, but given there's
current logic for handling accesses to read-only regions in
hvm_hap_nested_page_fault() I think re-using that was the best way to
also handle accesses to MMIO read-only regions.

Arguably it would already be the case that for other reasons Xen would
need to emulate an instruction that accesses a read-only MMIO region?

Thanks, Roger.

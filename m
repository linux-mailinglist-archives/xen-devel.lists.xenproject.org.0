Could you clarify who you think wants to consume this information from
these format-less binary blobs? They're strictly internal to the test
harness.

Well, if we want to make it complicated, we could of course extract
the notes into a separate ELF object, and include that object in the
linking process. But these notes are wrong anyway: Whichever insns the
blobs use, test_x86_emulator does _not_ need CPU support for them, as
it'll suitably avoid executing any of the blobs. Similarly stack and
CET related information is not of interest for the blobs, only for the
"normal" object files.

Having looked into this some more, I'm still unsure whether this is a
viable thing to do. While we do have VALID_M2P() (checking the top bit
of the entry), its use is rather limited. The most noteworthy place
(but by far not the only one) where it's _not_ used is perhaps the
handling of MMU_MACHPHYS_UPDATE. Additionally there's no similar
checking of bit 31 for 32-bit guests at all. Hence at a first
approximation both (uint32_t)INVALID_P2M_ENTRY and
(uint32_t)SHARED_P2M_ENTRY are to be considered valid GFNs (albeit
they wouldn't have been on a 32-bit Xen, but those were similarly
lacking enforcement of this restriction anyway).

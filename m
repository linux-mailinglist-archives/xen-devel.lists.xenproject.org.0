Meanwhile I've realized that I neither need to resort to Arm here,
nor to floating point, e.g.

int test2(int in) {
	int i;
	register int ri asm("ecx") = in;
	asm("nop %0" : "=r" (i) : "0" (ri));
	return i;
}

You'll find that the resulting code (at -O2; gcc 10.2.0) doesn't
use %ecx at all - %edi gets moved directly to %eax.

Yes, I agree.

Indeed, this was my thinking as well. I was wondering whether we
could at least limit reporting each unhandled MSR only once per
domain. But yes, this would require at least two extra pages to
hold the required bitmaps (one for the MSRs starting at 0x00000000
and the other for the group up from 0xC0000000; a 3rd one for AMD
for the group up from 0xC0010000).

Or when, because of things working differently than before, people
need to be told to increase verbosity for debugging purposes.

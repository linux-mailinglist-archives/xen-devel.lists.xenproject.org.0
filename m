I am afraid I don't know enough the code to be able to say if it can be 
removed.

I also have no idea how common are such platforms nowadays (I suspect it 
is rather small). Which I why I went with a command line option.

Jan suggested to use timer-irq-works. Would you be happy with the name?

Ah yes. In the downstream version, I went with setting to true by 
default as we don't support any platform with broken timer. I forgot to 
update the patch before sending.

I can update the comment.

Sure.

The channel also seems to be used as a fallback method for calibrating 
the APIC (see calibrate_APIC_clock()). AFAICT, the fallback method 
should only be used when the PIT is enabled.

I think it would still be feasible to avoid running the IRQ tests even 
when PIT is used. So it means, we cannot skip preinit_pit().

As a side note, I noticed that preinit_pit() is called during resume. 
But I can't find any use of channel 0 after boot. So maybe the call 
could be removed?

But gcc _does_ provide a stdint.h.

I'm not sure about the last statement; I'm pretty sure we don't
check that we have such a compiler (in tools/configure).

Which they can't, as that would make them unusable in preprocessor
directives.

From a compiler perspective, "32-bit" and "x86" needs further pairing
with an OS, as it's the OS which defines the ABI. This is why further
up I did say "It is technically correct at this point in time, from
all we can tell" - we imply that all OSes we want to be able to build
on provide a suitable ABI, so we can use their compilers.

Okay, if that would have been your example, then since there are
no further expressions involved here you agree parentheses aren't
needed here?

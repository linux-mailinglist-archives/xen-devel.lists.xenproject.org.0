Yes, I did configure the runner only to execute protected jobs. The
$CI_COMMIT_REF_PROTECTED check in automation/gitlab-ci/test.yaml is
needed so that the xilinx job won't be created on pipelines for
non-protected branches where the runner won't run, hence the job has no
chance of completing successfully.

If I don't add the $CI_COMMIT_REF_PROTECTED check, the job will be
created in the pipeline but it will remain stuck as "paused" waiting for
the runner to become available (but the runner never will.)

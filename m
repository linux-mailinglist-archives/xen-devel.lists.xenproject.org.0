Same here

I realize 3 years have passed and it is a long time, but many
downstreams (including some which are widely used) don't rebase
regularly and we are still missing lots of tests from gitlab-ci. The
unfortunate result is that it can take years to realize there is a
breakage. We need more gitlab-ci (or OSSTest) tests.

I am convinced by Daniel's argument here:

https://marc.info/?l=xen-devel&m=171215093102694
https://marc.info/?l=xen-devel&m=171215073502479

I would ack Andrew's revert. If we decide to revert Andrew's revert, I
also think that we should make the alternative solution, whatever that
might be, a blocker for Xen 4.19.

My favorite alternative solition is Daniel's suggestion of adding a
check to the dummy XSM policy. I am not sure if this is the same thing
you mean with "change the XSM policy consistently".

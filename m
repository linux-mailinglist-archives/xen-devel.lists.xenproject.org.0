I'm afraid I'm lost: Neither passing hardware size nor BUG() would
happen in a release build, so getting this wrong does mean memory
corruption there. And I'm of the clear opinion that debug builds
shouldn't differ in behavior in such regards.

If there wasn't an increasing number of possible combinations I
would be inclined to suggest that in all builds we check during
boot that calculation and hardware provided values match for all
possible (valid) combinations.

I can fully understand this aspect. I'm not opposed to printk_once()
at all. My comment was purely towards the override.

I don't think there's a need here - what you have in terms of info
put into the log is imo sufficient.

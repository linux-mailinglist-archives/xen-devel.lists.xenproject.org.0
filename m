I don't know enough about these headers to express an informed opinion,
but it does sound like a useful cleanup. Do you think it would allow
<asm/paravirt_types.h> to include <linux/mm_types.h>? This is what we
would need to have a generic definition of lazy_mmu_state_t (which could
be overridden by defining some __HAVE_ARCH macro in <asm/mmu.h>).

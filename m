After reflecting on it, I believe that was not the correct action. The
policy should handle setting/checking all access control state and fail
with an error of why and then allow the hypervisor logic decided what to
do with that failure. For the policies that are present today, yes it is
an immediate panic. Ultimately this will future proof the interface
should a future policy type be introduced with a more varied result that
could allow the hypervisor to continue to boot, for instance to a
limited and/or debug state.

This goes back to an issued I have raised before, is_privileged really
encompasses two properties of a domain. Whether the domain is filling
the special control domain role versus what accesses the domain has
based on the context under which is_control_domain() is called. For
instance the function init_domain_msr_policy() uses is_control_domain()
not to make an access control decision but configure behavior. Under
flask is_privileged no longer reflects the accesses a domain with it set
will have, thus whether it is cleared when flask is enabled is
irrelevant as far as flask is concerned. For the ASSERT, what matters is
that the label was set to xenboot_t on construction and that it was not
changed before reaching this point. Or in a short form, when under the
default policy the expected state is concerned with is_privilege while
for flask it is only the SID.

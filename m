We had a chat about this during the Arm maintainer calls. The 
disagreement boiled down to the fact that SUPPORT.md (or the 
documentation) doesn't say anything about whether loading Xen above 2TB 
was supported or not. Depending on the view, one could consider a bug or 
not.

Looking through the documentation, the best place to document might 
actually be misc/arm/booting.txt where we already have some requirements 
to boot Xen (such the binary must be entered in NS EL2 mode).

I will prepare a patch and send one.

Cheers,

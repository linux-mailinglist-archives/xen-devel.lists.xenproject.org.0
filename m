Ok. I do not understand what you mean by "leaving the URL proposal in 
just the cover letter". Which URL?



I'm sorry, I didn't notice your previous reply. I'm going to address 
your observations now:

To my knowledge, there is not a standard format to define a project 
deviation for a certain MISRA rule in Xen right now (this can also be 
discussed in a separate thread). To clarify, I meant to describe why I 
wasn't addressing these violations in the patch (they are the vast 
majority, but they do not have any implication w.r.t. functional safety 
and can therefore be safely deviated with an appropriate written 
justification).

Understood.

The rationale behind these modifications was to separate clearly 
comments and code samples, so that the latter can be easily deviated by 
tool configurations. I'm ok with the suggestion of removing the nested 
comments, and otherwise leave the code as is, but i'll probably do this 
by splitting the patch as you suggested above.

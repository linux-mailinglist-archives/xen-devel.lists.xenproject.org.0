No, we don't access descriptor tables in guest space, I don't
think. See read_gate_descriptor() for an example. After all PV
guests don't even have the full concept of self-managed (in
their VA space) descriptor tables (GDT gets specified in terms
of frames, while LDT gets specified in terms of (VA,size)
tuples, but just for Xen to read the underlying page table
entries upon 1st access).

Hmm, yes indeed.

I think this being a debugging function only, not directly
accessible by guests, is what made me think speculation is
not an issue here and hence the "unsafe" variants are fine
to use (they're slightly cheaper after all, once the
subsequent changes are in place). But I guess I will better
switch these two around.

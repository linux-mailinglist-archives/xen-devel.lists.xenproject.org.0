It's quite the other way around: The EFI loader applies relocations
to put the binary at its loaded _physical_ address (the image gets
linked for the final virtual address). Hence we need to apply the
same relocations a 2nd time (undoing what the EFI loader did)
before we can branch from the physical (identity mapped) address
range where xen.efi was loaded to the intended virtual address
range where we mean to run Xen from.

For the ELF binary the symbols are needed solely to make ld happy.

There were such plans, yes, but from the last round of that series
I seem to recall that there was at least one issue breaking this
idea. So no, at this point I'm not intending to take precautions to
make that work easier (or not further complicate it). This said, I
don't think the change here complicates anything there.

Well, once I know what exactly you're missing there, I can certainly
try to expand it.

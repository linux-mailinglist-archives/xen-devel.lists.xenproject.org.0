The YAJL functions needs to stay in the API, they've been exposed on
purpose in this header... The only user of those I know is `xl`. They
are limited since your application also needs to use libyajl. I think
I've butchered this header enough to make it complicated to use for
applications that are not `xl`.

libxl_json.h is only part of the header, there's a second part that is
automatically generated, _libxl_types_json.h.

While we could simply move the few prototype that uses json-c support
listed here to an actually private header, there's still the
autogenerated header to deal with. I feel like it would simpler to avoid
installing both headers (libxl_json.h and _libxl_types_json.h) when we
compile the tools with json-c. And even maybe add a fake "libxl_json.h"
which only have an "#error" saying the json helper aren't available
anymore.

Thanks,

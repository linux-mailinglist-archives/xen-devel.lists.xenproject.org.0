Funny you should give this example: Assuming you mean xfree(), it
specifically tolerates both NULL and ZERO_BLOCK_PTR (the latter
because xmalloc() may return it, and that's what it was invented
for). But yes - other non-NULL checking guards would indeed break.

I'm afraid every possible solution here has its downsides, and
the suggested change simply follows the pattern we used so far in
similar cases - without anyone objecting.

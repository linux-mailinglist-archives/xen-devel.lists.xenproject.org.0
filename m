It's a good point however to have only one file to handle exclusions, and use that file to generate the exclusion list dynamically, but then someone might want to exclude certain files only in some analyses and not others, which is not a good fit for exclude-list.json as it is now.

The single source of truth is supposed to be
docs/misra/exclude-list.json, which has an entry for radix-tree with a
simple explanation:

        {
            "rel_path": "common/radix-tree.c",
            "comment": "Imported from Linux, ignore for now"
        },

However, reading the code and also Nicola's answer, I can see that
automation/eclair_analysis/ECLAIR/out_of_scope.ecl is adding extra
excludes on top of exclude-list.json. There are three groups of files:

1) Intel specific source files are out of scope
2) Build tools are out of scope
3) Out of scope headers


Nicola, I think that 2) and 3) should be in
docs/misra/exclude-list.json. Do you recall why it was not done this way
in the first place? Can we make the change now?


In regard to 1), I would leave it in out_of_scope.ecl for now. Ideally
we wouldn't need an exclude list for Intel files because we should be
able to exclude them using Kconfig options. But of course when we
started the MISRA project there was no way to do that and even now the
Kconfig infrastructure might not be able to remove all the files in
group 1).

As we are working on adding a second ECLAIR scan with a larger
configuration, it would make sense to add all the files in group 1) to
that scan.

I would prefer to keep them disabled in the smaller ECLAIR scan
configuration that we have today for a simple reason: I think our
priority for that scan should be to reach zero violations as fast as
possible to mark as many rules as possible as blocking. I am hesitant to
increase the scope until we do that because it could be
counter-productive.

I am happy to make the relevant changes to docs/misra/exclude-list.json
(and automation/eclair_analysis/ECLAIR/out_of_scope.ecl.)

Jan do you also agree as well? If yes, I'll work out exactly how to
proceed based on whether removing radix-tree from exclude-list.json
trigger other violations or not.

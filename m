Agreed.

The buddy allocator could never have given out page 0 on x86 because it 
is part of the first MB of the RAM (see arch_init_memory() in 
arch/x86/mm.c). AFAIK, the first MB cannot be freed..

The change in the buddy allocator was to address the Arm side and also 
make clear this was a problem this is a weakness of the allocator.

When do you expect the pages to be carved out from the buddy allocator?

I can see only two situations:
	1) Workaround a bug in the allocator.
         2) A CPU errata requiring to not use memory.

In the case of 1), it is still safe for a domain to run with that page. 
However, we don't want to give it back to the page allocator. A solution 
is to mark them as "offlining/broken". Alternatively, you could remove 
the swap the page (see more below).

In the case of 2), it is not safe for a domain to run with that page. So 
it is probably best to swap the pages with a new one. For HVM domain 
(including the P2M), it should be easy. For PV domain, I am not entirely 
sure if that's feasible.

Cheers,

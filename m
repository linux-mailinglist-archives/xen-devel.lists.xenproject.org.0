Can we do something like KVM's ignore_msrs (but probably return 0 on reads to avoid leaks from the system)? It would allow to deal with cases when a guest is suddenly unable to boot after hypervisor update (especially from pre-4.14). It won't help in all cases since some MSRs may be expected to be non-zero but I think it will cover large number of them. (and it will certainly do what Jan is asking above but will not be specific to this particular breakage)

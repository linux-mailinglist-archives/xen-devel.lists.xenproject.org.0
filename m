Take a look at

https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/

I'm unconvinced a reference needs adding here.

Can do; splitting this for AMD/Hygon however was merely to
facilitate using it for both vendors, though.

To avoid the casts (also below) I could introduce local variables.
I specifically wanted to avoid MASK_EXTR() such that the rest of the
calculations in

            if ( (uint8_t)(msrval >> 40) )
                printk("%u..", (factor * (uint8_t)(msrval >> 40) + 50) / 100);
            printk("%u MHz\n", (factor * (uint8_t)(msrval >> 8) + 50) / 100);

can be done as 32-bit arithmetic.

Did you go through the MSR lists for the various models? It's there
where I found this anomaly, not in any spec updates.

Hmm, the calculation looks to be in units of 10kHz, until the division
by 100. I don't think we'd cap at 4GHz this way.

Well, all callers would need to be changed to pass the address of
the variable to store the value read into. That's quite a bit of
code churn, and hence nothing I'd want to do in this patch.

If I was touching any of the three lines anyway - yes. But the way
it is it looks like an unrelated change to me.

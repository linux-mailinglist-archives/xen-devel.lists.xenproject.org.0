What other hypervisors might or might not do should not be a factor in
this discussion and it would be best to leave it aside.

From an AMD/Xilinx point of view, most of our customers using Xen in
productions today don't use any hypercalls in one or more of their VMs.
Xen is great for these use-cases and it is rather common in embedded.
It is certainly a different configuration from what most are come to
expect from Xen on the server/desktop x86 side. There is no question
that guests without hypercalls are important for Xen on ARM.

As a Xen community we have a long history and strong interest in making
Xen more secure and also, more recently, safer (in the ISO 26262
safety-certification sense). The VMF work is very well aligned with both
of these efforts and any additional burder to attackers is certainly
good for Xen.

Now the question is what changes are necessary and how to make them to
the codebase. And if it turns out that some of the changes are not
applicable or too complex to accept, the decision will be made purely
from a code maintenance point of view and will have nothing to do with
VMs making no hypercalls being unimportant (i.e. if we don't accept one
or more patches is not going to have anything to do with the use-case
being unimportant or what other hypervisors might or might not do).

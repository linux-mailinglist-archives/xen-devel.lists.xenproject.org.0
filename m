(Yay for internal ticket references escaping into the wild.)


However, it is very important to be aware that this is just papering
over the problem, and it will cease to function as soon as we get MKTME
support.Â  When we hit that point, iPAT cannot be used, as it will cause
data corruption in guests.

The only correct way to fix this is to not (mis)use BAR space for RAM
mappings.

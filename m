This additional variance arises from the quantization, and so it scales with
the timing quantum.  It makes sense that it has a larger effect on a lower
frequency clock -- if you imagine trying to calibrate against a clock which
runs at 1 Hz, without this term you would read several identical values from
that clock and conclude that your clock runs at infinity Hz.

Most statistics courses present a formula for the absolute uncertainty in the
slope rather than the relative uncertainty.  But it's easy to derive one from
the other.

Suppose it takes exactly 1 us to run through the loop but one of the clocks
runs at exactly 1000001 Hz.  Without the extra delay, we'll probably observe
the clock incrementing by 1 every time through the loop (since it would only
increment by 2 once a second) and end up computing the wrong frequency.  The
"noise" introduced by adding small (variable) delays eliminates any chance
of this scenario and makes the data points behave like the *random* data
points which the statistical analysis needs.

You're too generous... I think the only real Xen work I did was adding support
for indirect segment I/Os to blkfront.  Mostly I was just packaging things up
for EC2 (back when EC2 used Xen).

The "give up after 1 second" thing is just "fall back to historical FreeBSD
behaviour".  In my experiments I found that calibrating against the i8254
we would get 1PPM in about 50 ms while HPET was 2-3 ms.

FWIW, my first version of this code (about 5 years ago) used fixed-point
arithmetic.  It was far uglier so I was happy when the FreeBSD kernel became
able to use the FPU this early in the boot process.

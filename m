Do you mean this is not supported after your changes or this was never 
supported? (see more below).

There are a few nodes in the DT without compatible (e.g. cpus, memory, 
chosen, soc). So I am a bit confused why this is a problem.

> it is not described in arm/device-tree/booting.txt,

Up until Xen 4.4, we had the following sentence:

"
Each node has the form /chosen/modules/module@<N> and contains the 
following properties:
"

This was removed by commit af82a77f3abc "xen: arm: remove innaccurate 
statement about multiboot module path". But, IMHO, the new wording still 
doesn't explicit says the module should be directly in /chosen.

> and it is only rarely used.

Hmmm... We have quite a few examples on the wiki that create 'module' 
under 'modules'. In fact, we have provided U-boot script [2] that can be 
easily re-used. So I would not call it rare.

Hmmm... Looking at the implementation of efi_arch_use_config_file() in 
4.12, we are looking for the compatible "mutiboot,module". So I would 
say this is supported.

I think the first question we need to resolved is whether this has ever 
been supported in EFI. I think it was and therefore this is technically 
a regression.

That said, outside of the dom0less case, I don't expect any UEFI users 
will bother to create the nodes manually and instead rely on GRUB to 
create them. So I think breaking it would be OK.

I am less convinced about breaking it for non-UEFI case. That said, I 
think the documentation should be updated either way for 4.16 (the more 
if this has been broken as part of recent changes).

> I'd just update the wikipage.

There are quite a few places to update on the wiki page. AFAICT, they 
are all related to U-boot, so I don't think there is an action needed here.

Cheers,

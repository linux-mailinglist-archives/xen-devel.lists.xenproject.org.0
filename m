There are changes in the p2m code and the memory allocation for boot 
domains. So is it really encapsulated?

For me there are two risks:
  * p2m (already mentioned by Luca): We modify the code to put foreign 
mapping. The worse that can happen if we don't release the foreign 
mapping. This would mean the page will not be freed. AFAIK, we don't 
exercise this path in the CI.
  * domain allocation: This mainly look like refactoring. And the path 
is exercised in the CI.

So I am not concerned with the domain allocation one. @Luca, would it be 
possible to detail how did you test the foreign pages were properly removed?

Cheers,

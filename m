Ah good point. I agree with this one.

You have a point for the phandle. Yet, this is the only way dom0 can 
find the event channel today. As we exposed it, I don't think we can 
remove it until we have a proper replacement.

We might get away if the feature is not supported it at all. But there 
is no statement, so it is a little unclear whether the feature is meant 
to be in technical preview.

In any case, I think the commit message deserve a bit more explanation 
as hiding "xen,evtchn-v1"/"xen,domain-shared-memory-v1" is not 
uncontroversial.

My concern here is we exposed such information to dom0. So as I said 
above, I don't think we can simply remove it as there is no other way to 
find such information today.

It doesn't matter that it wasn't exposed to domU.

AFAIK the static event channel support was not added in Linux until very 
recently. Also, I think the kernel doesn't directly use the static event 
channel. So it is possible, this is just an overlook.

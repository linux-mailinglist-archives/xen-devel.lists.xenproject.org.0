It would have been better to raise a concern/objection before you
committed the feature.

It was a very clear intent of upgrading Kconfig and switching to Kbuild,
to clean up the total and chronic mess we call a build system.Â  It has
been discussed multiple times in person, and on xen-devel, without
apparent objection at the time.

The state of 4.14 and later is that we have the feature, and it is
already in use, with a lot more use expected to continue fixing the
build system.

You are currently blocking work to fix aspects of the build system based
on a dislike of this feature, *and* expecting someone else to justify
why using this feature as intended is ok in the first place.

I do not consider that a reasonable expectation of how to proceed.

If you wish to undo what was a deliberate intention of the
Kconfig/Kbuild work, then it is you who must start the conversation on
why we should revert the improvements.

x86 ==> deprecate both, user and system emulation support on
         32-bit hosts
arm ==> deprecate only system emulation on 32-bit hosts.

I tried to say it with the sentence "there is no real need for 32-bit x86 
host support and for system emulation on 32-bit arm hosts anymore, so it 
should be fine if we drop these host  environments soon" ... not sure why 
it's unclear, but if you have some better sentences, I'm open for suggestions.

I just did a try in a fresh build directory, and for me it was working: it 
builds qemu-img, qemu-io, qemu-edid etc. just fine.

What was missing in your case?

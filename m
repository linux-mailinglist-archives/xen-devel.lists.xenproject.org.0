I am also unease with a new lock "variant". However, this is the best 
proposal I have seen so far to unblock the issue.

I am open to other suggestion with simple locking discipline.

They may be unnecessary today but if tomorrow someone decide to rework 
the other lock, then you are just re-opening a security hole.

IHMO, having a sane locking system is far more important than removing 
locking that look "unnecessary".

Well, it is at least going towards that...

"Variability" is an understatement - there's no poisoning at all
in release builds afaics (and to be honest it seems a somewhat
pointless to write the same values over and over again in debug
mode). With this, ...

... what's your suggestion? Basing on _just_ CS.RPL obviously won't
work. Not even if we put in place the guest's CS (albeit that
somewhat depends on the meaning we assign to the macro's returned
value). Using current inside the macro to determine whether the
guest is HVM would also seem fragile to me - there are quite a few
uses of guest_mode(). Which would leave passing in a const struct
vcpu * (or domain *), requiring to touch all call sites, including
Arm's.

Compared to this it would seem to me that the change as presented
is a clear improvement without becoming overly large of a change.

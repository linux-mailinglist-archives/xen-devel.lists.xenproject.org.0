It is limited to HAP and PT - we're in p2m_pt_init() here. This is
also why I don't want to move it to e.g. p2m_initialise(), as that
would be the wrong layer.

This looks to go along the lines of what I'd put up as a post-
commit-message remark in "x86/p2m: collapse the two
->write_p2m_entry() hooks". The nested handler is perhaps the
bigger problem with such merging, plus it would feel a little like
a layering violation (which is why I did put up the question
instead of doing it right away).

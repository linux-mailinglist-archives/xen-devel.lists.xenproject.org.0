But RVI should be updated in vmx_intr_assist in that case, since
nvmx_intr_intercept shouldn't intercept the interrupt, as it should be
handled normally.

Well, patch 1/3 is a revert of f96e1469, so just reverting f96e1469
gets us to that state.

This patch is an attempt to clarify that nvmx_update_apicv is closely
related to the Ack on exit feature, as it modifies SVI in order to
signal the vector currently being serviced by the EXIT_INTR_INFO vmcs
field. This was not obvious to me, as at first sight I assumed
nvmx_update_apicv was actually injecting that vector into the guest.

Yes, patch 3/3 is the one that fixed the issue. Note however that
strangely enough removing the call to nvmx_update_apicv (as my first
attempt to solve the issue) did fix it on one of my boxes. It depends
a lot on the available vmx features AFAICT.

Hm, it was hard for me to figure out that SVI is modified here in
order to signal that the Ack on exit vector is currently in service,
as opposed to being injected using the virtual interrupt delivery
mechanism.

I just wanted to clarify that the purpose of this function is not to
inject the vector in intr_info, but rather to signal that such vector
has already been injected using a different mechanism.

I'm happy to reword this, but IMO it should be clear that the purpose
of the function is not so much to inject an interrupt, but to update
the virtual interrupt delivery field in order to signal that an
interrupt has been injected using a different mechanism.

Thanks, Roger.

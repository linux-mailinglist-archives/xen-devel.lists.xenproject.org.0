Actually, I should have finished my first cup of tea and looked closer 
at the patch in the larger context instead of the description, as the 
two do not align. You are correct, and provided I am not wrong here, the 
change is a no-op formatting change that removes an intermediate 
variable. I do not see how directly checking the return in an if versus 
checking the return stored in a variable. Additionally, the claim is 
that this occurs when XSM is enabled, which is also incorrect. The only 
difference at this location in code between not having XSM enabled and 
having it enabled is that for the latter, xsm_getdomaininfo() is an 
in-lined version versus a function call. In either case, both will 
return 0 unless you are using FLASK and have a policy blocking the 
domain from making the call.

V/r,
Daniel P. Smith

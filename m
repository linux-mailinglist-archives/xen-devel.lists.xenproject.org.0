Subject: [PATCH for-4.15] xen/sched: Add missing memory barrier in vcpu_block()
Date: Sat, 20 Feb 2021 19:47:01 +0000
Message-Id: <20210220194701.24202-1-julien@xen.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
MIME-Version: 1.0

From: Julien Grall <jgrall@amazon.com>

The comment in vcpu_block() states that the events should be checked
/after/ blocking to avoids wakeup waiting race. However, from a generic
perspective, set_bit() doesn't prevent re-ordering. So the following
could happen:

CPU0  (blocking vCPU A)         |Â   CPU1 ( unblock vCPU A)
                                |
A <- read local events          |
                                |   set local events
                                |   test_and_clear_bit(_VPF_blocked)
                                |       -> Bail out as the bit if not set
                                |
set_bit(_VFP_blocked)           |
                                |
check A                         |

The variable A will be 0 and therefore the vCPU will be blocked when it
should continue running.

vcpu_block() is now gaining an smp_mb__after_atomic() to prevent the CPU
to read any information about local events before the flag _VPF_blocked
is set.

This is a follow-up of the discussion that started in 2019 (see [1])
regarding a possible race between do_poll()/vcpu_unblock() and the wake
up path.

I haven't yet fully thought about the potential race in do_poll(). If
there is, then this would likely want to be fixed in a separate patch.

On x86, the current code is safe because set_bit() is fully ordered. SO
the problem is Arm (and potentially any new architectures).

I couldn't convince myself whether the Arm implementation of
local_events_need_delivery() contains enough barrier to prevent the
re-ordering. However, I don't think we want to play with devil here as
the function may be optimized in the future.

This patch is candidate for 4.15. The risk is really small as the memory
ordering will be stricter on Arm and therefore less racy.

AFAICT the APIC ID in CPUID leaf 0x1 %ebx is only reported to HVM
guests, not PV ones (see the dynamic section of guest_cpuid()).  This
paragraph might need adjusting then, as it reads to me as if PV
guests could also expect APIC_ID == vCPU_ID * 2.

With this change no x{,2}APIC ID gets exposed in CPUID for PV guests
unless it's for compat reasons for guests that already saw the x2APIC
feature.

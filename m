Hm, yes, that might be a sensible approach, but right now I don't want
to block this series on such (likely big) piece of work.  I think we
should aim for HVM and PV to have the same IOMMU page table levels,
and that's currently limited by the p2m code only supporting 4 levels.

Oh, it's a prereq because I've found AMD systems that have reserved
regions > 512GB, but no RAM past that region.  arch_iommu_hwdom_init()
would fail on those systems when patch 3/3 was applied, as then
reserved regions past the last RAM address are also mapped in
arch_iommu_hwdom_init().

Thanks, Roger.

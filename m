For cppcheck, every finding is an error as it is placed within <errors> section in XML.
cppcheck differentiates different types of findings by using "severity" element which can be e.g. error, style, warning, etc.
cppcheck-html uses this field to group findings into categories and present it in a nice format to be seen on a web browser.
However there is currently no way to tell cppcheck to find only errors.

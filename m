This is one way to look at things, yes. But if you take the
other perspective that special pages shouldn't be
IOMMU-mapped, then the divergence is the price to pay for
being able to share pages (and it's not Julien introducing
bad behavior here).

Additionally it may be possible to utilize the divergence to
our advantage: If one way of setting up things works and the
other doesn't, we have a reasonable clue where to look. In
fact the aspect above may, together with possible future
findings, end up being a reason to not default to or even
disallow (like for AMD) page table sharing.

I take a different perspective: IOMMU page tables shouldn't
get created (yet) at all in the course of
XEN_DOMCTL_createdomain - this op is supposed to produce an
empty container for a VM.

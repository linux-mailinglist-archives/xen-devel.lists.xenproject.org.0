local, or not, is down to --prefix, but I do like the idea of having a
trivial test runner put into sbin for humans to use.

Automation such as OSSTest and XenRT will want to track tests
individually for reporting and/or regression purposes.Â  But humans
wanting to test their change want an easy "run everything and confirm ok".

This is precisely why `./xtf-runner -aqq` exists.

If it comes down to it, we can define a new ABI if we need to make an
change, and can't find a compatible way of doing it.

But I don't see this plausibly happening for "simple".

It's somewhat rude to lump every test with needing to use getopt, but I
suppose we ought to do something.

That isn't robust.Â  For the examples given, they all yield EOPNOTSUPP,
and from that alone, you can't distinguish "Xen really can't do $X" from
"Someone regressed Xen's logic", but you can't distinguish "shadow
unavailable" from "HVM unavailable" like this.

Really, what you want is:

if ( xen claims feature $X )
Â Â Â  success = ("text $X" == SUCCESS)
else
Â Â Â  success = ("test $X" == EOPNOTSUPP)

Because that will allow you to spot "someone broke the domain
construction logic around $X".


Combined with the orchestration framework's idea of "what should Xen be
able to do", you also have:

success = ("xen claims $X" == "xen ought to claim $X")

which allows you to spot "someone broke Xen's ability to spot/enable $X
on boot".


Other similar testable areas here are:

foreach interesting CPUID bit:
Â Â Â  if ( bit supported in guest )
Â Â Â  Â Â Â  success = ("vm configured with $X" == "$X visible in guest") &&
Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  ("vm configured without $X" == "$X not visible in guest")
Â Â Â  else
Â Â Â  Â Â Â  success = "vm configured with $X" rejected during construction


There is absolutely a time and a place for the simple tests, and there
is a lot of value in having them, but a small piece of C isn't capable
of doing this higher level reasoning.

Reasoning this fine grained *is* important given the shear complexity of
virtualisation, and I fully intend that the "simple", and this
"not-quite-so-simple" set of autotests will be sufficiently quick as to
be minutes worth of testing, and live in the Gitlab/patchew pre-commit
testing.

~Andrew

P.S. if its not already clear by now, I've spent a lot of time trying to
figure out how to turn "something, somewhere, went wrong" bug reports
into something more useful for a test robot to report, at the point that
it has figured out that something went wrong.

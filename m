I've looked around some more and also remembered an aspect because
of the looking around.

1) xargs has special provisions to not overrun argument space (leaving
a gap of 2048 bytes). Nothing like this is said in the spec for find,
and in fact I recall having had issues when the accumulated arguments
needed splitting. This was on an old distro, but I wanted to mention
it.

2) I've found (old) indications that the {} may be troublesome to
some distros (Solaris was mentioned) and might need quoting. (This
would of course be easy to deal with.)

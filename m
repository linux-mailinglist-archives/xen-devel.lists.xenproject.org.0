OK, I can add to the commit message:

"Note an HVM vCPU can operate normally without making use of
vcpu_info, and in fact does so when brought up from the local APIC."

I didn't intended to do this here, as replied to Andrew.  If we want
to get rid of the check for PV also it needs to be done in a different
patch, and with a different justification and analysis.

Quite possibly, I didn't look that close TBH, since my intention was
not to remove dummy_vcpu_info.  I've noticed however that
__update_vcpu_system_time() checks for v->vcpu_info_area.map == NULL,
which is fine, but shouldn't it also check for v->vcpu_info_area.map
== &dummy_vcpu_info, as it's pointless to update the vcpu system time
if pointing to the dummy_vcpu_info?

Thanks, Roger.

Thanks.

Yes, this was another consideration of mine as well. But it
is a fact that we treat rip and rsp differently in this
regard. Perhaps generated code overall could benefit from
treating rsp more like rip, but this would need careful
looking at all the involved pieces - especially in cases
where the updated stack pointer gets further used we may
not be able to defer the truncation to complete_insn:.

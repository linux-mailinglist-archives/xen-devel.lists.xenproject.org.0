We do, in fact the pvshim (or nested Xen) will run in x2APIC mode if
available.

Linux >= 5.17 will also use x2APIC mode if available when running as a
Xen HVM guest:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c8980fcb210851138cb34c9a8cb0cf0c09f07bf9

If a guest has been booted with the bogus LDR we need to keep it on
migrate, otherwise at least Xen will break (because it does read the
LDR from the hardware instead of building it based on the APIC ID).

Switching to the correct LDR on APIC reset can be sensible, any APIC
device reset should be done together with updating whatever registers
have been previously cached, and OSes don't do APIC resets anyway.

Yeah, I've heard similar things for lowpri mode.  It's also valid to
implement as a round-robin.

Thanks, Roger.

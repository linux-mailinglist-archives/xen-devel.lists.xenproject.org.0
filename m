Subject: [PATCH 0/1] Adjust odd Python bindings
To: xen-devel@lists.xenproject.org
X-Spam-Status: No, score=1.5 required=10.0 tests=DATE_IN_PAST_06_12,

First off, this isn't properly tested.  I know it compiles, but that may
not mean much when this encounters the Real World.

I'm doing initial exploration for a project involving Xen.  Python seems
a good language for the project, so I'm trying out the Python bindings
for Xen.

What I've noticed is the bindings seem wrong.  Importing xen.lowlevel.xc,
then creating a xen.lowlevel.xc.xc() object has too many layers.  The
extra ".xc" is a distinct mismatch for comparable tools.  As such I'm
trying to get rid of the duplicated layer for both xc and xs.

The Python documentation indicates the name given to Extension() should
be the full name, not just the package name.  As such that is being
adjusted too.

I haven't yet done testing beyond confirming this builds, since further
checking will take some time to do...

I'm unsure how widely the Python bindings are used.  Certainly they were
used for PyGRUB.  Have any other projects used them so far?  What I'm
doing is likely to be contributed to the Xen Project, and I suspect the
existence of other projects would be known...

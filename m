The rationale of this rule is as follows:

- With a complex hierarchy of nested header files, it is possible
   for a header file to be included more than once.

- This can bring to circular references of header files, which
   can result in undefined behavior and/or be difficult to debug.

- If multiple inclusion leads to multiple or conflicting definitions,
   then this can result in undefined or erroneous behavior.

- Compilation and analysis time is needlessly increased.

There has been a period (which lasted until the end of the '70s
or the beginning of the '80s, I would have to dig up to be
more precise) when the solution was thought to be "headers
shall not to be included by other headers but only by .c files."
Experience then showed that, in medium to large projects,
each .c file had to begin with a long list of #include
directives;  such lists needed to be ordered to accommodate
the dependencies between header files;  in some cases the
lists were so long that:

a) it was a kind of black magic to find out the right
    inclusion order, one that would work in any of
    possibly many project configurations;
b) the lists of #include directives often contained duplicates,
    possibly because the desperate programmers where trying
    to find the right order.

In the end, the software engineering community converged
on the idea that guards against multiple inclusion are
a much better alternative.

Of course there are valid reasons to deviate the rule:
some header files might be conceived to be included
multiple times.  A one-line configuration for ECLAIR
will do the trick to make sure such header files are
not reported.

Kind regards,

    Roberto

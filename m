> Specifically the case we see is that a 64-bit memory BAR is programmed by writing the lower half and then the upper half. After the first write the BAR is mapped to an address under 4G that happens to contain RAM, which is displaced by the mapping. After the second write the BAR is re-mapped to the intended location but the RAM displaced by the other mapping is not restored. The OS then continues to boot and function until at some point it happens to try to use that RAM at which point it suffers a page fault and crashes. It was only by noticing that the faulting address lay within the transient BAR mapping that we figured out what was happening.

In order to fix this isn't it enough to just disable memory and IO
decodes, leaving bus mastering as it is?

I assume there is (or was) some reason why bus master is enabled by
hvmloader in the first place?

Thanks, Roger.

I'm afraid it's more complicated, and hence ...

... this doesn't hold: As I notice only now the struct also wrongly
(if it was meant to be a tools-only interface) failed to use
XEN_GUEST_HANDLE_64(), which would in principle have been a problem
for 32-bit callers (passing garbage in the upper half of a handle).
It's not an actual problem because, unlike would typically be the
case for tools-only interfaces, there is compat translation for this
struct.

With this, however, the problem of your change becomes noticeable:
The structure's alignment for 32-bit x86, and with it the structure's
sizeof(), both change. You should be able to see this by comparing
xen/common/compat/memory.c's disassembly before and after your
change - the number of bytes to copy by the respective
copy_from_guest() ought to have changed.

The question now is whether we're willing to accept such a (marginal)
incompatibility. The chance of a 32-bit guest actually running into
it shouldn't be very high, but with the right placement of an
instance of the struct at the end of a page it would be possible to
observe afaict.

Or whether we go the alternative route and pad the struct suitably
for 32-bit.

This was already part of 4.13, as you imply by requesting a backport.
Hence the bogus header had already been shipped.

This comment is now stale.

How would checking just the TR selector help? If other pieces of TR
or syscall/sysenter were out of sync, we'd be hosed, too.

I'm also not sure what exactly you mean to do for such an assertion:
Merely check the host VMCB field against TSS_SELECTOR, or do an
actual STR to be closer to what the VMSAVE actually did?

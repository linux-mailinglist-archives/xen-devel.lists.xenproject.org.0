Perhaps - this is a header you introduce aiui, so it's up to
you to arrange for it to include all further headers it
depends upon. In such a case (new header) you don't need to
explicitly justify what you include, but of course you don't
want to include excessive ones, or you risk getting back
"Why?" from reviewers.

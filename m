Hm, yes, what I wanted to say is that this is not exclusive to 64bit
PV, as with IBRS disabled ring 3 and ring 0 share the same predictor
mode.  Anyway, not relevant.

Sorry, I think I didn't word that very well.  The remark is tied to
the one below about the vmassist 'possibly' allowing the guest to
disable IBPB on guest user -> kernel context switches, but Xen might
unconditionally do additional IBPBs that the guest cannot disable.

Isn't it kind of a very specific case that we end up doing a
user->kernel switch as part of a context switch?  IOW: would require
the vCPU to be scheduled out at that very specific point.

Are you sure?  I see VMASST_TYPE_pae_extended_cr3 getting set in
dom0_construct_pv() and that makes me wonder whether other bits
couldn't start set also.

Maybe there's some restriction I'm missing, but I don't see any
wording in the description of the interface that states that all
assists are supposed to start disabled.

Thanks, Roger.

Yes I read it... But I didn't check the original license and ...

... I didn't assume anything here. I made a generic statement because 
your e-mail lead to think that all the submitter made a conscious decision.

Note that, from past discussion, we agreed that it would be fine to 
re-license from gplv2+ to gplv2-only without requesting the original 
author. So technically there is a choice.

As a side note, "blindly" is not very inclusive. We may have different 
view, but it doesn't mean yours is better than mine (and vice-versa). 
You could have express your opinion without saying "blindly" and it 
would have come across less rude.

Strictly speaking we can refuse any code. That count for license as 
well. Anyway, I didn't request a change here. I merely pointed out that 
any use of GPLv2+ should be justified because on Arm most of the people 
don't pay attention on the license and pick the one from an existing file.

The various timer modes were all compatibility, and IIRC, mostly for
Windows XP and older which told time by counting the number of timer
interrupts.

Paul - you might remember better than me?

Its possibly worth noting that issues in this are cause triple faults in
OVMF (it seems to enable interrupts in its timer handler), and breaks
in-guest kexec (because our timer-targetting logic doesn't work in a way
remotely close to real hardware when the kexec kernel is booting on a
non-zero vCPU).

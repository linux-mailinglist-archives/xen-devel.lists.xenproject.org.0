There are a number of such files in the tree which aren't used to
record configure results. Whether their existence could actually
case a problem with this approach I can't tell. Would it be
possible to ...

... make this a static pattern rule for just the file names that
are actually processed / produced by configure? Of course it
wouldn't be very nice to have to keep in sync that list and what
the various configure.ac scripts list in AC_CONFIG_FILES() et al.
But not listing the targets explicitly would always risk the rule
to kick in for a file where it's not supposed to apply.

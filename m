Hm, I'm unsure.  What else do you see becoming part of those
functions?  It's hard for me to suggest a name when it's unclear what
future logic do you think they could contain.

Given the current code I still think something that contains 'fill' or
similar is way more appropriate, the more if the IBT check is pulled
out into the caller.

You could possible declare it as an static inline in the hvm.h header
for the time being?

Isn't that a bit redundant?  I would prefer to not have duplicated
comments over the code, hence my suggestion to place part of the logic
in the caller.

Yes, I also think this is not great, and prefer your current proposal.

Oh, OK, that's better then.

Thanks, Roger.

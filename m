The RB was given quite some time ago, so I felt it was probably best
to drop it in case you wanted to re-asses the patch.  Specially given
you have now done the work to also add support for this feature to
assembly annotated functions.

OK, I can integrate some of this wording in the commit message.

The thunk sections will currently be consumed by *(.text.*) when using
split sections.  Looking at the assembly for them I think they are
suitable annotated to create the right symbols for livepatch tools to
pick.  They won't however have the right alignment just yet, as I
expect that will get solved with your follow up patch to respect
CONFIG_FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT in assembly annotated functions also.

Thanks, Roger.

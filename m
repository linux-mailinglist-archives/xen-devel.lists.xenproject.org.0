RISC-V is already using dom0less code, however in a downstream
repository. To make progress faster the code was copied (not shared)
from arch/arm to arch/riscv. More details on the Xen community call this
week. https://gitlab.com/xen-project/people/olkur/xen/-/blob/riscv_aia_support/xen/arch/riscv/domain_build.c?ref_type=heads

Hyperlaunch also needs dom0less code to be made common to make progress:
https://marc.info/?l=xen-devel&m=169154172700539

So I think that there is an immediate RISC-V and X86 need.

But the point about "moving the code now will mean moving part of it
back in arm in the future" is valid. How do we move forward?

I don't think we want to block Luca's progress to wait for more
plumbings done on x86 or RISC-V. Also we don't want to scope creep
Luca's series too much.

But I think the goal should be to move dom0less code to xen/common as
soon as possible and make it arch neutral. How do we get there?

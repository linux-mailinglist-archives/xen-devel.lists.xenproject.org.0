I think, allocating YUV buffers through CREATE_DUMB interface is just
an *abuse* and *misuse* of this API for now.

Take the NV12 format as an example, NV12 is YUV420 planar format, have
two planar: the Y-planar and the UV-planar. The Y-planar appear first
in memory as an array of unsigned char values. The Y-planar is followed
immediately by the UV-planar, which is also an array of unsigned char
values that contains packed U (Cb) and V (Cr) samples.

But the 'drm_mode_create_dumb' structure is only intend to provide
descriptions for *one* planar.

struct drm_mode_create_dumb {
     __u32 height;
     __u32 width;
     __u32 bpp;
     __u32 flags;
     __u32 handle;
     __u32 pitch;
     __u64 size;
};

An width x height NV12 image takes up width*height*(1 + 1/4 + 1/4) bytes.

So we can allocate an *equivalent* sized buffer to store the NV12 raw data.

Either 'width * (height * 3/2)' where each pixel take up 8 bits,
or just 'with * height' where each pixels take up 12 bits.

However, all those math are just equivalents description to the original
NV12 format, neither are concrete correct physical description.

Therefore, allocating YUV buffers through the dumb interface is just an
abuse for that API. We certainly can abuse more by allocating two dumb
buffers, one for Y-planer, another one for the UV-planer. But again,dumb buffers can be (and must be) used for *scanout* directly. What will yield if I commit the YUV buffers you allocated to the CRTC directly?

In other words, You can allocated buffers via the dumb APIs to store anything,
but the key point is that how can we interpret it.

As Daniel puts it, the semantics of that API is well defined for simple RGB
formats. Usages on non linear RGB dumb buffers are considered as undefined
behavior.

Peoples can still abusing it at the user-space though, but the kernel don't
have to guarantee that the user-space *must* to be able to continue doing
balabala..., That's it.

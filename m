Please note that my proposal (and hence the working prototype)[1]
is based on Xen's virtio implementation (i.e. IOREQ) and particularly
EPAM's virtio-disk application (backend server).
It has been, I believe, well generalized but is still a bit biased
toward this original design.

So I hope you like my approach :)

Let me take this opportunity to explain a bit more about my approach below.

Yet another way here is that we would have well known "shared memory" between
VMs. I think that Jailhouse's ivshmem gives us good insights on this matter
and that it can even be an alternative for hypervisor-agnostic solution. 

(Please note memory regions in ivshmem appear as a PCI device and can be
mapped locally.)

I want to add this shared memory aspect to my virtio-proxy, but
the resultant solution would eventually look similar to ivshmem.

In Xen's IOREQ solution (virtio-blk), the following information is expected
to be exposed to BE via Xenstore:
(I know that this is a tentative approach though.)
   - the start address of configuration space
   - interrupt number
   - file path for backing storage
   - read-only flag
And the BE server have to call a particular hypervisor interface to
map the configuration space.

In my approach (virtio-proxy), all those Xen (or hypervisor)-specific
stuffs are contained in virtio-proxy, yet another VM, to hide all details.

One of difficulties on Xen that I found in my approach is that calling
such hypervisor intefaces (registering IOREQ, mapping memory) is only
allowed on BE servers themselvies and so we will have to extend those
interfaces.
This, however, will raise some concern on security and privilege distribution
as Stefan suggested.

I think that VM configuration management (or orchestration in Startos
jargon?) is a subject to debate in parallel.
Otherwise, is there any good assumption to avoid it right now?

In my approach,
 a) BE -> FE: interrupts triggered by BE calling a hypervisor interface
              via virtio-proxy
 b) FE -> BE: MMIO to config raises events (in event channels), which is
              converted to a callback to BE via virtio-proxy
              (Xen's event channel is internnally implemented by interrupts.)

I don't know what "connect directly" means here, but sending interrupts
to the opposite side would be best efficient.
Ivshmem, I suppose, takes this approach by utilizing PCI's msi-x mechanism.

As I said above, my proposal does the same thing that you mentioned here :)
The difference is that I do call hypervisor interfaces via virtio-proxy.

Given that we may want to implement BE as a bare-metal application
as I did on Zephyr, I don't think that the translation would not be
a big issue, especially on RTOS's.
It will be some kind of abstraction layer of interrupt handling
(or nothing but a callback mechanism).

My proposal document might help here; All the interfaces required for
virtio-proxy (or hypervisor-related interfaces) are listed as
RPC protocols :)

Exactly. I have no confident yet that my approach will also apply
to other hypervisors than Xen.
Technically, yes, but whether people can accept it or not is a different
matter.

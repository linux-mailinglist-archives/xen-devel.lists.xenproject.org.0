Not really. dominfo.dying is only set if the domain is dead (i.e. 
DOMDYING_dead). This is happening *after* everything has been 
relinquished. So this is quite late compare to what you seem to want.

Do you mean before domain_kill() is called? If so, maybe we should call 
domain_kill() before hand.

The other alternative, would be to notify the Xenstored that domain is 
never going to come back.

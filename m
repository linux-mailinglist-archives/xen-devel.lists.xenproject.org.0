The Fixes tag carries useful information but the problem is that it is
typically used for identifying backports and this is not a backport (at
least today we would not consider it a backport).

So I would provide the same information but without using the Fixes tag.
For instance: "This commit fixes an issue that was introduced by XXX
because of YYY and only affects the AVA platform with not up-to-date
firmware".

That way, we avoid the risk of someone taking all the applicable commits
with a Fixes tag and backporting them without thinking twice about it.
But we still have the information in the git log.

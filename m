But is this going to be the only per-hart thing that will need doing? Otherwise
the same larger "container" function may want calling instead.

Okay, since that's easily feasible with the present implementation, why not
keep it like that then.

Oh, right, I should have commented on the function return type only.
Yet then I also can't resist stating that this kind of use of a variable,
which initially is assigned a value that doesn't really fit its name, is
easily misleading towards giving such comments.

Please check ./CODING_STYLE again as to the use of fixed-width types.

But that guest will run on another hart.

That may bring you more problems than it solves. You'd need to stash away
the value originally read somewhere. And that somewhere isn't per-CPU data.

Well - I'd like the pre-conditions to be understood better. For example, can
a hart really speculate into guest mode, when the hart is only in the
process of being brought up?

That's better described as "VMIDs aren't used" then?

Did you look at the x86 code again, or the patch that I sent for it?

Even if in practice x86 systems are symmetric in this regard, you will
have seen that we support varying values there as well. Up to and
including ASIDs being in use on some CPUs, but not on others. So that
code can serve as a reference for you, I think.

No, why? While I didn't Cc you on my patch submission, I specifically
replied to it with you (alone) on the To: list, just so you can look
there first before suggesting (sorry) odd things.

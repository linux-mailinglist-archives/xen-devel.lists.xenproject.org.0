One thing to note is that if Xen has difficulties in distinguishing
between armv7 and armv8/aarch32 a guest will have the same issue. Given
that mvfr2 is not available on armv7, how can a guest safely attempt to
read it?

If somehow the guest figures out that it is running on armv8/aarch32,
then it could read mvfr2, but we could return "not implemented" in that
case, right? In other words, part of me thinks that maybe we are
overcomplicating this, especially because we don't officially support
Xen on armv8/aarch32 as you wrote (we need to update SUPPORT.md).

So I would be tempted to only do the following:

- read mvfr2 on arm64
- never read mvfr2 on aarch32 (no matter armv7 or armv8)
- keep c->mvfr.bits[2] as zero on armv7 and armv8/aarch32 so that if the
  guest attempts to read it, it won't crash but simply return zero


The most important things in regards to armv8/aarch32 are:

- be able to boot Xen armv8/aarch32 for our own arm32 testing of Xen
- be able to boot an armv7 and armv8/aarch32 guest on Xen armv8/aarch64

Both these things should work correctly with the simple approach above.


Your idea of trying to figure out if we are running on armv8/aarch32 via
ID_DFR0.CopDbg is clever but I think it is a bit overkill for a mode of
execution that we don't support. I don't think is worth the effort.

But if you think differently, I can invest some time in investigating
this further, following your line of thought on finding a register to
detect the mode of execution. (However I don't have any hardware to test
this anymore.) Otherwise, if you agree that the simpler approach is
sufficient, then I'll send a patch as described above.

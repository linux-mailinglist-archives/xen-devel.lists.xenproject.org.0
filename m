As far as I can tell QEMU only sets this bit to 1 (in hardware) if it exposes an I/O BAR to the guest.

In Xen, I think we should use rsvdp_mask for domUs for now since we don't (yet) support I/O BARs for domUs in vPCI.

Actually, PCI_COMMAND_WAIT bit is in qemu's res_mask, meaning it only passes through the writes in permissive mode. By default qemu does not pass through writes. PCI LB 3.0 and PCIe 6.1 specifications say devices should hardwire this bit to 0, but that some devices may have implemented it as RW. So I think we should use rsvdp_mask in Xen for this bit.

Will do. The rsvdp_mask (in the write path) has already been applied before reaching this handler, so the guest's write value won't propagate to the header->guest_cmd variable. This is okay as long as ...

... we don't provide an emulated view of the additional bits that we're treating as RsvdP. So let's not provide such an emulated/fake view for these bits (for now, at least).

Side note: qemu does provide such an emulated view, using a combination of emu_mask and emulated register variables. Looking at the qemu history, it looks like there may be other registers where we'd likely want to have such an emulated/fake view. So, regardless of whether we want to emulate certain bits in the command register, having the flexibility of a emulated mask/register in vPCI could (eventually) be beneficial (but not as part of this series). I'll make an in-code comment that we may want to re-visit this in the future.

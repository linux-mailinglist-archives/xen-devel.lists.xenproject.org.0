Hm, OK, but isn't the limit 80 columns according to the kernel coding
style (Documentation/process/coding-style.rst)?

I don't mind adjusting, but if you are going to ask every submitter to
limit to 75 columns then the coding style document should be updated
to reflect that.

Xen would need to be made aware of the devices exposed behind the VMD
bridge, so it can manage them.  For example Xen is the entity that
controls the local APICs, and hence interrupts must be configured by
Xen.  Xen needs knowledge about the devices behind the VMD bridge,
and how to access those devices PCI config space to at least configure
MSI or MSI-X capabilities.  It could possibly be exposed similarly to
how Xen currently deals with ECAM areas.

None of this is present at the moment, could always be added later and
Linux be made aware that the limitation no longer applies.  That would
require changes in both Xen and Linux to propagate the VMD information
into Xen.

Would you be OK with something like:

"Xen doesn't have knowledge about devices in the VMD bus because the
config space of devices behind the VMD bridge is not known to Xen, and
hence Xen cannot discover or configure them in any way.

Bypass of MSI remapping won't work in that case as direct write by
Linux to the MSI entries won't result in functional interrupts, as
it's Xen the entity that manages the local APIC and must configure
interrupts."

Thanks, Roger.

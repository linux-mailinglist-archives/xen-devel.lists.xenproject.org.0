The other solution is to remove completely the SMMUv3 node from the 
IORT. This would require more work as you would need to fully rewrite 
the IORT.

Hence why I suggested to speak with the spec owner (it seems to be Arm) 
to reserve 0xff as "Invalid/Ignore".

By writing node->type, you already invalidate the content because the 
software cannot know how to interpret it. At which point, zeroing it 
should make no difference for software parsing the table afterwards. 
This may be a problem for software parsing before hand and keeping a 
pointer to the entry. But then, this is yet another reason to no updated 
the host IORT and create a copy for dom0.

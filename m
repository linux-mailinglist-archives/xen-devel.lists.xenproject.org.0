The respective changes in libxl date back to 2016/2017, and the involved
code looks identical between 4.13 and 4.14. Perhaps there's some 4.13-
only logic in libvirt, which really means to be >= 4.13? In any event
libxl_types.idl clearly says the two u.hvm fields are deprecated;
nevertheless there are some uses left for u.hvm.acpi (the most
suspicious one in xl_sxp.c) and exactly one in a comment for u.hvm.apic.
Sadly this marking of being deprecated doesn't get reflected in the
_libxl_types.h which gets installed for public consumption.

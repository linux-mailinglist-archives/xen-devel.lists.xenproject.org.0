The toolchain dependency can't be broken, because of incssp and wrss in C.

There is 0 value and added complexity to trying to partially support
legacy toolchains.Â  Furthermore, this adds a pile of nops into builds
which have specifically opted out of CONFIG_XEN_SHSTK, which isn't ideal
for embedded usecases.

As a consequence, I think its better to keep things consistent with how
they are now.

One thing I already considered was to make cpu_has_xen_shstk return
false for !CONFIG_XEN_SHSTK, which subsumes at least one hunk in this
change.

I can't currently think of any option better than leaving these ifdef's
in place, other than perhaps

#ifdef CONFIG_XEN_SHSTK
# define MAYBE_SETSSBSY ALTERNATIVE "", "setssbsy", X86_FEATURE_XEN_SHSTK
#else
# define MAYBE_SETSSBSY
#endif

and I don't like it much.

The think is that everything present there is semantically relevant
information, and dropping it makes the code worse rather than better.

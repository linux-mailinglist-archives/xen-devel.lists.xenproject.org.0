I assume you are referring to mmap()? I ask because I think there
are numerous counter examples (some even in the C standard):
malloc() & friends allow for either behavior. memcpy() / memmove()
happily do nothing when passed a zero size. read() / write()
are at least allowed to read/write nothing (and return success)
when told so. Otoh I notice that a zero vector count passed to
readv() / writev() is indeed an error, yet nothing is said at all
about individual vector elements specifying zero size.

Plus of course I don't think POSIX is the main reference point
here, when the rest of the hypercalls allowing for some form of
batching permit empty batches.

I'd be really happy to be educated of the complications; sadly
so far you've only claimed ones would exist without actually
going into sufficient detail. In particular I don't view placing 

    if ( size == 0 )
        return 0;

suitably early coming anywhere near "complexity". Even more so
that as per your reply you mean to undo removal of a respective
check, just that in your version it'll return an error instead
of success.

I'm not concerned enough of the introduced inconsistency to
outright veto you doing so, but I still don't think this is an
appropriate step to take under the present conditions.

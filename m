TBH this is not clear to me even with your original commit message.

IMO it's fine to use lists to describe specific points, but using
lists exclusively to write a commit message makes the items feel
disconnected between them.

The format of the commit message by Andrew is clearer to undertsand

Thanks, Roger.

This has been in my todo list for more than year but didn't yet find 
anyone to finish the work.

I need to have a look how much left the original work it is left to do. 
Would you be interested to contribute?

I am not very familiar with this. So a few questions:
  * Does this mean the OS needs to be modified?
  * What happen for emulated device?

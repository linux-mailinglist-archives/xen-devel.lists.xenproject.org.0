Who are you going to blame? You did nothing to your OS or application s/w, so you are going to blame the cloud provider of course.

That's a situation OSes are in all the time. Buggy applications may
stop working on newer OS versions. It's still the application that's
in need of updating then. I guess OSes may choose to work around
some very common applications' bugs, but I'd then wonder on what
basis "very common" gets established. I dislike the underlying
asymmetry / inconsistency (if not unfairness) of such a model,
despite seeing that there may be business reasons leading people to
think they want something like this.

> Now imagine you are the cloud provider, running Xen. What you did was start to upgrade your hosts from an older version of Xen to a newer version of Xen, to pick up various bug fixes and make sure you are running a version that is within the security support envelope. You identify that your customer's problem is a bug in their OS that was latent on the old version of the hypervisor but is now manifesting on the new one because it has buggy support for a hypercall that was added between the two versions. How are you going to fix this issue, and get your customer up and running again? Of course you'd like your customer to upgrade their OS, but they can't even boot it to do that. You really need a solution that can restore the old VM environment, at least temporarily, for that customer.

Boot the guest on a not-yet-upgraded host again, to update its kernel?

The only part of this that is introducing something that is stable is the libxl part, and I think the 'feature' bitmap is reasonable future-proof (being modelled on the viridian feature bitmap, which has been extended over several releases since it was introduced).

I.e. basically an arbitrary choice. This is again a symmetry /
consistency / fairness issue. If a guest admin pesters his cloud provider
enough, they may get the cloud provider to make hypervisor adjustments.
If another guest admin simply does the technically correct thing and
works out what needs fixing in the kernel, they may then figure they
simply didn't shout loud enough to avoid themselves needing to do much
work.

Anyway - I guess I'm about the only one seeing this from a purely
technical, non-business perspective. I suppose I'll continue looking at
the code for the purpose of finding issues (hopefully there aren't going
to be any), but will stay away from acking any parts of this. Whoever
agrees with the underlying concept can then provide their acks. (As said
elsewhere, in the particular case of the kexec issue with FIFO event
channels here, I could maybe see that as halfway acceptable
justification, albeit I did voice my concerns in that regard as well.
It's still working around a shortcoming in guest software.)

Nevertheless I'd like to gain clarity of what the plans are with future
ABI additions.

It does solve one of the issues: the sporadic failure of the gitlab-ci
job. Even if the fix is not complete, if nothing else, it does that.

Of course, if someone comes up with a better fix all the better!

There hasn't been a lot of movement on this issue so I am being
pessimistic and I am offering the (maybe partial) solution we have
today. I don't mean to take anything away from the value of doing a
better fix.

I think I could write a document covering the intended behavior at the
time of contributing the original feature. That might be good to have
regardless of the bug.

Making it harder to fix properly would be a valid reason not to commit
the (maybe partial) fix. But looking at the fix again:

diff --git a/tools/xenstored/domain.c b/tools/xenstored/domain.c

It is a 1-line movement. Textually small. Easy to understand and to
revert. It doesn't seem to be making things harder to fix? We could
revert it any time if a better fix is offered.

Maybe we could have a XXX note in the commit message or in-code
comment?


> Tell me, when was the last time this failed...

I went through all the gitlab reports and this is the last one I found
which is from 1 month ago:
https://gitlab.com/xen-project/xen/-/pipelines/953569140

Even if the heinsenbug manifests only once a month I think it is bad.
Of course it is up to Henry but I don't think we should go far into the
release process without this problem being (at least partially) fixed.

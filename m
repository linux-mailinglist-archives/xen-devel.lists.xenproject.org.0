I think especially in pass-through code there are a number of cases
where the per-domain lock really is being abused, simply for being
available without much further thought. I'm not convinced documenting
such abuse is going to help the situation. Yet of course I can see
that having documentation would make review easier ...

Okay, I'll drop patch 1 and also patch 6 for being overly controversial.
Some of the other patches still look worthwhile to me, though. I'll
also consider moving the spin->r/w lock conversion last in the series.

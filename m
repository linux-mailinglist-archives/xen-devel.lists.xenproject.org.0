I'm afraid I don't fully follow: For one, does what you say imply HLE is
no longer enumerated in CPUID? If so, and if we assume all CPU models
listed have had suitable ucode updates issued, we could indeed drop the
workaround (as taking effect only when HLE is enumerated). But then this
erratum does not have the usual text effectively meaning that an ucode
update is or will be available to address the issue; instead it says
that BIOS or VMM can reserve the respective address range. This -
assuming the alternative you describe is indeed viable - then is surely
a much more intrusive workaround than needed. Which I wouldn't assume
they would suggest in such a case.

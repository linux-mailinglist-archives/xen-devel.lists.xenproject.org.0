Is there any other possible usage for the xenpci MMIO BAR?  My
understanding is it was introduced for this specific purpose; to
signal a safe place to map the grant-table or foreign mappings, which
in both cases want to have an effective WB cache attribute.

I agree, however this will take more time to materialize IMO.  Needs a
patch to Linux, plus possible backports, and then distros picking the
updates.

While I agree this needs fixing in Linux, I don't see any downsides of
doing the workaround in hvmloader also, as a faster way to get it
deployed with just a Xen update.

Right, thanks.  I was grepping for 'Field("BIOS"', instead of 'Field(BIOS'.

As for 1), you could combine all the ports in one node.

I am not sure for both. For the writing part: In one hand, it is nice to 
have all the event channels defined in one place. One the other hand, it 
is more messy if you want to visually check that you don't duplicate the 
event channels.

It may also end up to be complex to read if you have many events 
channels. So if we go with 1), I think we would want to allow multiple 
nodes to help the user to keep a clean/readable DT.

You will need to loop over all the nodes in chosen to find "xen,evtchn" 
and also fetch two phandles.

See above, I am not sure the code to parse will end up to be much bigger 
because we would still need to loop on the nodes in chosen and fetch two 
phandles.

That said, we are potentially going to need to loop on more nodes.

So overall, I am 50/50 on which one to chose.

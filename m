Do you mean that specifically this patch or the whole patch series is moving us
in unwanted direction? (1)

It doesn't clear based on change log why this patch is sent outside "Introduce
CONFIG_DOMCTL" (2) as it looks the same as in (2) and it was reverted once with
the reason "for breaking the x86 build". (I haven't checked what was changed so
it won't lead to build issue again.)

In the current context, I think I prefer option 3.
However, if option 1 is possible, it could also be consideredâ€”except in the
case where the answer to (1) is that the whole patch series is moving us in
an unwanted direction. In that situation, IMO, only option 3 remains viable.

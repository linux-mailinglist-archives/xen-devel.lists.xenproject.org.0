Consider applying that same reasoning to "1" instead of "4".Â  In that
case, a1 would no longer be bound to %rdi.

The use of "4" explicitly binds the input and the output, which includes
requiring them to be the same register.

Furthermore, LLVM tends to consider "not behaving in the same was as
GCC" a bug.

Convention is not created by you getting irritated at others getting
irritated at you for requesting bizarre and unusual changes in submitted
code, or by continuing to point things out, knowing that others
specifically disagree with your reasoning in this case.

Convention is created when there is general agreement over the technical
merits of writing code in one particular way vs the alternatives, *and*
its written down somewhere, so this argument does not continue any further.

There is no restrictions or guidance in the coding style to prefer one
form over another, therefore anything is acceptable.

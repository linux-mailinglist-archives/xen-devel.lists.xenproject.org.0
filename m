Like sadly is the case in so many areas nowadays, this to me suggests
that you value short term benefits over things working correctly long
term. Yes, it is important to be attractive to users. But this would
better not be at the price of keeping in place workarounds for overly
long periods of time, possible even forever. Such is likely to bite
us (perhaps by way of biting some of our users) down the road.

To be honest, I find it very strange that the original report over a
month ago was never followed up by the necessary technical detail.
Andrew did tell me that outside of the report on the mailing list he
did explicitly ask for such. (I can't rule out that meanwhile he was
given the info, but really all of this would better be on xen-devel.)

Well, feel free to throw more engineering resources into Xen's
(upstream) maintenance. There being a much larger community of
engineers around KVM is perhaps the main reason here.

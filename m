As said - I don't think there is, but I've not done a full audit.

Either approach may be okay, I think. It would really depend on
how little of share_xen_page_with_guest() suffices for the dom_io
assignment.

I see Paul has already answer this part. You can't drop the setting
of the flag, but you could make it dependent upon d != dom_io.

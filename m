The interrupt will get set in IRR and handled when interrupts are
enabled.

Yeah, there's a small window where the fields in call_data are out of
sync.

That the other option, but I have impression it's more fragile to
adjust the condition in send_IPI_mask() rather than fiddle with
get_cpu_maps().

However if that's the preference I can adjust.

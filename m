I'm generally okay with this approach, but wouldn't want to give it
my R-b until it's at least clear it's not entirely unacceptable to
anyone else (Andrew in particular). Couple of remarks:

I take it that it's intentional that you didn't allow separate read
and write control?

While to some degree a matter of taste, I think such variables needed
only inside a switch() and not needing an initializer would better
live in the respective switch()'s scope.

So what are your thoughts wrt my change to this file? Drop it
altogether and require people to use this new option? Or do you
see both coexist? In the latter case, since you had suggested
that I drop the write side of my change - does your changing of
the write path indicate you've changed your mind?

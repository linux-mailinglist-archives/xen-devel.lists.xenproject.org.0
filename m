To a large degree that's up to you. It's just that, as said, if
you had done so, you'd likely have noticed the issue, and hence
doing so here and elsewhere may provide reassurance that there's
no further similar case lurking anywhere.

Personally I'd prefer "curr" named function parameters. But if
Andrew or Wei agree with your approach, I'm not going to object.

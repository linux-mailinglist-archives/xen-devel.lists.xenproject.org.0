Okay, I will move their introduction to there.

Btw, what is needed to add Misra checking for RISC-V? I started to think that, probably,
it will make sense to do that from the start.

Sorry, missed to write that I'll change irq to irq_bit or something like that.

 From Xen code point of view, I am not sure if it legitimate or not. I've not any
issue, at the moment, with such implementation, but to be on a safe side I'll
implement default case as panic("...").

> I guess I don't understand the concern.

for example, if we will have the following code:
   void some_caller(struct irq_desc *desc)
   {
       if ( desc->handler->set_affinity )
           desc->handler->set_affinity(desc, cpu_mask);
   }

Then we will skip the call of handler->set_affinity() (if it was just initialized with
.set_affinity = NULL) without any notification. And it is fine specifically in this
case as aplic_set_irq_priority() does nothing.

But what about the cases if it is a function which will have some implementation in the
future but doesn't have implementation for now. Then without notification that this
function is unimplemented we could skip something what really matters.

But I think that your initial comment was just about the function which basically
does nothing. Am i right?

I think that not solely, for example, if IMSIC isn't available then we should skip
the calls of imsic_irq_enable(), at least, and this variable could be used for that
purpose.

But I will double check if we have better indicator. At the moment, I don't think
we have better, probably, except checking of aplic.regs->domaincfg if bit APLIC_DOMAINCFG_DM
is set.

The reason for a bitop in Arm is explained in this commithttps://gitlab.com/xen-project/xen/-/commit/50d8fe8fcbab2440cfeeb65c4765868398652473
but all the places where plain C operators were changed to bitops are actually executed under|spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock, flags). By quick look I found only two 
places one in __setup_irq() but it is called by the functions which do ||spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock, flags) and in vgic_v2_fold_lr_state(). 
Maybe, I'm missing something.|
|RISC-V won't have something similar to ||vgic_v2_fold_lr_state|(), but __setup_irq() is used in a similar way. It can be added ASSERT(spin_is_lock(&desc->lock))
and then it will also safe to use non-bitop function.
Probably, it is a little bit safer to use always bitops for desc->status.

As I understand, based on Arm, code then Xen enables interrupts corresponding to devices assigned
to dom0/domU before booting dom0/domU, resulting in the possibility of receiving an interrupt
and not knowing what to do with it. So it is needed for enablement of IRQs when the guest
requests it and not unconditionally at boot time.

Yes, if one day support for guest interrupts without IMSIC support will be added for APLIC.
(at the moment, we are planning only to have APLIC+IMSIC support as this way is hypervisor-aware)

Oh, sure, if *->is_used will still present in the next patch series then I'll re-use here "imsic".

As APLIC is used in MSI mode it requires to enable/disable interrupts not

aplic_irq_{enable,disable}() it is introduced imsic_irq_{enable,disable)().

For the purpose of aplic_set_irq_affinity() aplic_get_cpu_from_mask() is
introduced to get hart id.

Also, introduce additional interrupt controller h/w operations and

    <pre>for example, if we will have the following code:

          desc-&gt;handler-&gt;set_affinity(desc, cpu_mask);

Then we will skip the call of handler-&gt;set_affinity() (if it was just initialized with
.set_affinity = NULL) without any notification. And it is fine specifically in this
case as aplic_set_irq_priority() does nothing.

But what about the cases if it is a function which will have some implementation in the
future but doesn't have implementation for now. Then without notification that this
function is unimplemented we could skip something what really matters.

But I think that your initial comment was just about the function which basically
does nothing. Am i right?</pre>

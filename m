233 to be precise.

GCC can't distinguish init from non-init functions as far as the
improved typechecking (patch 56) goes, so omitting __init would cause
compilation issues.

Furthermore, CET-IBT is only one Control Flow Integrity scheme
attempting to use a nominally arch-neutral interface.Â  There are others
(PaX RAP, and Intel's FineIBT) which have software components to them,
and for those, the function pointer callers and callees need to have all
appropriate ABI modifications.

I'm pretty certain that if we skipped annotation of the __init functions
for now, we'd have to add them in due course anyway.

We could defer enabling CET-IBT until late on boot, but enabling it
early gets us better coverage of issues until the first software scheme
turns up.

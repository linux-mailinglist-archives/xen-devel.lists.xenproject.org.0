    x86/mem-sharing: mov {get,put}_two_gfns()
    
    There's no reason for every CU including p2m.h to have these two
    functions compiled, when they're both mem-sharing specific right now and
    for the foreseeable future.
    
    Largely just code movement, with some style tweaks, the inline-s
    dropped, and "put" being made consistent with "get" as to their NULL
    checking of the passed in pointer to struct two_gfns.

    x86/mem-sharing: ensure consistent lock order in get_two_gfns()
    
    While the comment validly says "Sort by domain, if same domain by gfn",
    the implementation also included equal domain IDs in the first part of
    the check, thus rending the second part entirely dead and leaving
    deadlock potential when there's only a single domain involved.

    IOMMU: make DMA containment of quarantined devices optional
    
    Containing still in flight DMA was introduced to work around certain
    devices / systems hanging hard upon hitting a "not-present" IOMMU fault.
    Passing through (such) devices (on such systems) is inherently insecure
    (as guests could easily arrange for IOMMU faults of any kind to occur).
    Defaulting to a mode where admins may not even become aware of issues
    with devices can be considered undesirable. Therefore convert this mode
    of operation to an optional one, not one enabled by default.
    
    This involves resurrecting code commit ea38867831da ("x86 / iommu: set
    up a scratch page in the quarantine domain") did remove, in a slightly
    extended and abstracted fashion. Here, instead of reintroducing a pretty
    pointless use of "goto" in domain_context_unmap(), and instead of making
    the function (at least temporarily) inconsistent, take the opportunity
    and replace the other similarly pointless "goto" as well.
    
    In order to key the re-instated bypasses off of there (not) being a root
    page table this further requires moving the allocate_domain_resources()
    invocation from reassign_device() to amd_iommu_setup_domain_device() (or
    else reassign_device() would allocate a root page table anyway); this is
    benign to the second caller of the latter function.
    
    In VT-d's domain_context_unmap(), instead of adding yet another
    "goto out" when all that's wanted is a "return", eliminate the "out"
    label at the same time.
    
    Take the opportunity and also limit the control to builds supporting
    PCI.

    tools/migration: unify type checking for data pfns in the VM
    
    Introduce a helper which decides if a given pfn in the migration

    This highlights more clearly that type XEN_DOMCTL_PFINFO_XALLOC (a

    tools/python: handle libxl__physmap_info.name properly in convert-legacy-stream
    
    The trailing member name[] in libxl__physmap_info is written as a
    cstring into the stream. The current code does a sanity check if the
    last byte is zero. This attempt fails with python3 because name[-1]
    returns a type int. As a result the comparison with byte(\00) fails:
    
      File "/usr/lib/xen/bin/convert-legacy-stream", line 347, in read_libxl_toolstack
        raise StreamError("physmap name not NUL terminated")

    arm64: Change type of hsr, cpsr, spsr_el1 to uint64_t
    
    AArch64 registers are 64bit whereas AArch32 registers
    are 32bit or 64bit. MSR/MRS are expecting 64bit values thus
    we should get rid of helpers READ/WRITE_SYSREG32
    in favour of using READ/WRITE_SYSREG.
    We should also use register_t type when reading sysregs
    which can correspond to uint64_t or uint32_t.
    Even though many AArch64 registers have upper 32bit reserved
    it does not mean that they can't be widen in the future.
    
    Modify type of hsr, cpsr, spsr_el1 to uint64_t.
    Previously we relied on the padding after spsr_el1.
    As we removed the padding, modify the union to be 64bit so we don't corrupt spsr_fiq.
    No need to modify the assembly code because the accesses were based on 64bit
    registers as there was a 32bit padding after spsr_el1.
    
    Remove 32bit padding in cpu_user_regs before spsr_fiq
    as it is no longer needed due to upper union being 64bit now.
    Add 64bit padding in cpu_user_regs before spsr_el1
    because the kernel frame should be 16-byte aligned.
    
    Change type of cpsr to uint64_t in the public outside interface
    "public/arch-arm.h" to allow ABI compatibility between 32bit and 64bit.
    Increment XEN_DOMCTL_INTERFACE_VERSION.

I'm missing something, why should we accept a 0xff mode?  Don't modes
go up to 7 at most (0b111, mode 3).

I don't have a strong opinion.  Could be done in a separate change
anyway.  I guess since we are at it it might be worth to check for as
much as we can, even if it's not going to affect the logic.

I would prefer a separate change iff you want to implement this.

Oh, OK, so that explains the weird 0xff mode.

Thanks, Roger.

I have replied to this on Bertrand e-mail.

I will reply to this below.

This would mean we should de-support 2.7 which sounds wrong if it worked 
before.

I think we should remove the command line and tell the user to read the 
cppcheck README.md.

Well, if someone find a fix you want to check against all versions not 
the one that warns. Otherwise, you can end up in a situation where you 
silence cppcheck 2.10 (just making up a version) but then introduce a 
warning in cppcheck 2.7.

To me this is no different than other software used to build Xen. We 
don't tell the user that they should always build with GCC x.y.z. 
Instead, we provide a minimum version. This has multiple benefits:
  1) The user doesn't need to rebuild the software and can use the one 
provided by the distributions
  2) Different versions find different (most of the time) valid bugs. So 
we are getting towards a better codebase.

Cheers,

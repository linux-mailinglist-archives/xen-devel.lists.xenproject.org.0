Right, will change.

Yes - if __HYPERVISOR_CS32 would ever have been to be used for
anything, it would have needed checking for here.

As long as CS (a) gets properly saved (it's a "manual" step for
SYSCALL/SYSRET as well as #VMEXIT) and (b) didn't get clobbered. I
didn't write this code, I don't think, so I can only guess that
there were intentions behind this along these lines.

Well, I can switch to a purely CS.RPL based approach, as long as
we're happy to live with the possible downside mentioned above.
Of course this would then end up being a more intrusive change
than originally intended ...

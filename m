It's probably more a "happened to be that way and then it was easiest
to keep it like this", but I recall the behavior having been the subject
of discussions, with the outcome that it's at least "kind of" intended.

Would adding "kind of" make things look better to you?

If you had said "The more interesting ...", I'd have agreed. What I
was thinking of as possible uses (be it reading or writing) is
e.g. reset state that may depend on certain further properties.

Furthermore I was thinking of code paths that vCPU initialization
simply may re-use, and which expect the policy to at least be
available, irrespective of the individual MSRs' values still
being their reset ones.

Thanks. As far as adjustments go, I don't really see how to better
reflect what you want, considering my replies above. If you have
any hints ... (I'll hold off committing this for a little while,
but I think I'd like to put it in before I leave for weekend and
vacation.)

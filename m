How does such a comment help? I.e. how does the caller tell which MSRs
to pass here and which to deal with anyother way?

The latter is clearly one of the things to consider, yes (alongside
the respective bits in sub-leaf 0 for XCR0). Sub-leaves > 1 may also
need dealing with ECX. Yet then again some or all of this may need
handling elsewhere, not the least because of the unusual handling of
leaf 0xd in the hypervisor. What gets checked and/or adjusted where
needs to be settled upon, and then the different parts of code would
imo better cross-reference each other.

Indeed I did.

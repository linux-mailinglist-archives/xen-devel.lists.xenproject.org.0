Perhaps, yes. But what do you do? There's potentially a huge value
range to probe ...

Which, as said elsewhere, has its own downsides - writable MSRs don't
need to also be readable. See e.g. AMD's proposed PARTIAL_{FS,GS}_LOAD
MSRs.

No - see the "goto done" added near the top of the function.

What I'm particularly trying to avoid here is to allow
information from an underlying hypervisor to "shine through",
even if it's only information as to whether a certain MSR is
readable. It should be solely our own selection which MSRs in
this range a guest is able to (appear to) read.

Plus of course by avoiding the rdmsr_safe() in this case we
also avoid the unnecessary (debug only) log message associated
with such attempted reads.

I am guessing you mean that we don't handle unaligned access? If so, yes 
I agree this helped with that.

And you don't like the existing code :). I am willing to compromise, but 
for that I need to understand why the existing code is technically not 
correct.

So far, all the arguments you provided in v3 was either a matter of 
taste or IMHO bogus.

Your taste is nor better nor worse than mine. At which, we need someone 
else to break the tie.

If I am not mistaken, Jan is also objecting on the proposal. At which 
point, we are 2 vs 1.

So there are three choices here:
   1) You find two others maintainers (including on Arm maintainer) to 
agree with you
   2) You provide arguments that will sway one of us in your side
   3) We keep be32_cpu*() (they are simple wrapper and I am willing to 
write the code).

Cheers,

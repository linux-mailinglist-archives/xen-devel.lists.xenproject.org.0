Lets take the example of free_xen_event_channel(). The function is 
checking if the port is valid. If it is, then evtchn_close() will be called.

At this point, it would be fair for a developper to assume that 
port_is_valid() will also return true in event_close().

To push to the extreme, if free_xen_event_channel() was the only caller 
of evtchn_close(), one could argue that the check in evtchn_close() 
could be a BUG_ON().

However, this can't be because this would sooner or later turn to an XSA.

Effectively, it means that is_port_valid() *cannot* be used in an 
ASSERT()/BUG_ON() and every caller should check the return even if the 
port was previously validated.

So I think a comment on top of is_port_valid() would be really useful 
before someone rediscover it the hard way.

Cheers,

Which I assumed was intentional: Always have the tests, to make sure the code
doesn't go stale (or even break).

Looking at the v2 code again I notice that while now you're running the tests
only when the to-be-tested function is referenced from elsewhere, the testing
has become independent of CONFIG_SELF_TESTS. I don't think that was intended?

Well - surely absolutely no question about this last aspect.

There's never an intermediate .S; it's always .s (not subject to C pre-
processing). Therefore I continue to struggle with how CPP macros would
come into (inconsistent) play here, unless they were used in construction
of the string literal (and then work similarly for gcc and Clang).

But as you say, we want to avoid playing with the intermediate file in
any event.

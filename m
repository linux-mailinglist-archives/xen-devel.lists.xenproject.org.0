Hmmm... I forgot to earlyprintk is x86 only. On Arm, you want to use 
earlycon=xenboot. This should be available as long as you build Linux 
with CONFIG_XEN=y. No need to detect Xen. However...

... this point is still valid if you want to use earlycon before it is 
actually initialized.

Apologies for the confusion.

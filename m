It looks like I misread the spec. :/ I thought it would only be a single 
possible value.

Hmmm... I am not sure about the value here as I don't know what would be 
the impact.

It might be better to detect whether we are running on Armv8 HW or Armv7 
HW. I haven't figured out an obvious way for that yet.

On IRC, Andre suggested a couple of options on IRC

  1) read ISAR5: This doesn't  seem to work as it is UNK on Armv7
  2) detect the VFP subarchitecture: It is not clear how this can be 
leveraged

While skimming through the spec, I noticed that ID_DFR0.CopDbg requires 
a specific value for Armv8.x spec. This is the debug architecture, but 
maybe we can leverage it?

Any better ideas?

Yes. But this may not work if we can't decide on the fixed value (see 
above).

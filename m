My understanding is that the !mfn_valid() check was a way to detect
MMIO regions in order to exit early and set those to UC.  I however
don't follow why the guest MTRR settings shouldn't also be applied to
those regions.

I'm also confused by your comment about "as such EPT entries would
never be marked present": non-present EPT entries don't even get into
epte_get_entry_emt(), and hence we could assert in epte_get_entry_emt
that mfn != INVALID_MFN?

I see, yes, the loop over the special pages array will need to be
adjusted to account for mfn_to_page() possibly returning NULL.

Overall I don't understand the need for this special case for
!mfn_valid().  The rest of special cases we have (the special pages
and domains without devices or MMIO regions assigned) are performance
optimizations which I do understand.  Yet the special casing of
!mfn_valid regions bypassing guest MTRR settings seems bogus to me.

Right, that behavior was still dubious to me, as I would assume those
regions would also want to fetch the type from guest MTRRs.

Thanks, Roger.

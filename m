Right, but maybe we can come up with a deprecation period?

Especially considering that this is for domU firmware (not host
firmware), and domU firmware is often (not always, but often) provided
by Xen (Xen in the sense of xen.git and Xen packages). First we fix EDK2
upstream and we update the EDK2 build in xen.git. Then we give it a
couple of releases, then we change the x86 hypercall behavior?

In the meantime we could print a warning in Xen DEBUG builds when the
hypercall is called and there is one existing mapping?

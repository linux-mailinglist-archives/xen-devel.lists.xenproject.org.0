It's hopefully obvious now why we suddenly finished the "lets turn all
unknown MSRs to #GP" work at the point that we did (after dithering on
the point for several years).

To put it bluntly, default MSR readability was not a clever decision at all.

There is a large risk that there is a similar vulnerability elsewhere,
given how poorly documented the MSRs are (and one contemporary CPU I've
got the manual open for has more than 6000 *documented* MSRs).Â  We did
debate for a while whether the readability of the PPIN MSRs was a
vulnerability or not, before eventually deciding not.

Irrespective of what we do to fix this in Xen, has anyone fixed Solaris yet?

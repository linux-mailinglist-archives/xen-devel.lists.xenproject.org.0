I don't think so, no. This can easily be a timing effect from the
heavy cache line bouncing involved here.

What I'm worried here seeing these updates is that I might still
be moving TSCs backwards in ways observable to the rest of the
system (i.e. beyond the inherent property of the approach), and
this then getting corrected by a subsequent rendezvous. But as
said - I can't see what this could result from, and hence I'm
inclined to assume these are merely effects I've not found a
good explanation for so far.

Yes, that's what I was hinting at with the above. For the next
rendezvous to not observe any skew, our adjustment would need to
be far more precise than it is today, though.

The APs' TSCs will have been running for about as long as the
BSP's, as INIT does not affect them (and in fact they ought to
be running for _exactly_ as long, or else tsc_check_reliability()
would end up turning off TSC_RELIABLE). So I expect skews to be
large enough at this point to be recognizable.

Ah yes. I tried something similar, but not quite the same,
and it looked wrong, so I gave up re-arranging.

It's not forbidden for the firmware to set the TSCs to some
huge negative value. Considering the effect TSC_ADJUST has on
the actual value read by RDTSC, I think I did actually observe
a system coming up this way, because of (not very helpful)
TSC_ADJUST setting by firmware. So no, no ASSERT_UNREACHABLE()
here.

I don't think we need this restriction. In fact, with this series it 
will become more a problem because the cpupool ID will based on how we 
parse the Device-Tree.

So for dom0, we need to specify explicitely the cpupool to be used.

IMHO removing the second restriction is a lot more risky than removing 
the first one.

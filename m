But what about duplicate EOIs, even if just by bug or erratum?
I notice, for example, that VMX'es VMEXIT handler directly
calls vlapic_handle_EOI(). I'd find it more safe if an
unexpected EOI didn't get any callback invoked.

As said on a different, but pretty recent thread: I do think
sharing is possible if devices and drivers meet certain criteria
(in particular have a way to determine which of the devices
actually require service). It's just not something one would
normally do. But iirc such a model was used in good old DOS to
overcome the 15 IRQs limit (of which quite a few had fixed
purposes, so for add-in devices there were only very few left).

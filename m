Except that there doesn't need to be any breaking: v1 could continue
to ignore all originally undefined flags. v1 and v2 could continue to
ignore all flags presently undefined. See also Julien's question
about GTF_sub_page on a transitive grant entry. That's presently an
ignored setting as well (and, as an implementation detail, in fact
getting forced to be set, but with a range covering the entire page).

Retroactively starting to check (and reject) undefined flags isn't
going to be nice; nevertheless I wanted to put this up as an at
least theoretical alternative. Perhaps a topic for the next community
call, if I don't forget by the time an agenda page appears.

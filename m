Hmm, yes, you're right.

Well, first - how likely is this, when instead we've been considering
whether we could get rid of shadow mode? And then this is balancing
between ease of future changes vs avoiding redundancy where it can be
avoided. I'm not going to insist on centralizing the HAP check, but I
certainly wanted the option to be considered.

This last aspect is the crucial aspect: start{svm,vmx}() are indeed quite
special because of this. Everywhere else we have accessor helpers when
hvm_funcs needs consulting, e.g. ...

... caps _reads_ would want using (an) accessor(s), too.

Right, I can see this as an argument when taking, as you do, speculation
on future needs into account. Albeit I'm then inclined to say that even
such modifications may better be done through accessor helpers.

Andrew - do you have any input here towards those somewhat vague plans
of getting rid of the hook functions? I guess they're more relevant in
places where we can't easily use the altcall machinery (i.e. not here).

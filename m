The proble of handling only MMIO case is that the issue still stays.
It will be hit with some other memory type since it's not MMIO specific.
The issue is that if global recalculation is called, the next hit to
this type will cause a transient fault which will not be handled
correctly after a due fixup by neither of our handlers.

My second alternative from my follow up email addresses this. I also
didn't like this aspect.

Since this is highly inconsistent at present, we first need to put
down a scheme, as I don't think we want _all_ #UD raising converted
to "goto unimplemented_insn". I've been thinking about where to draw
the line every time I've been adding new insns half-way recently,
but I didn't come to any good conclusion yet.

I'm not sure I'm following what is happening here, what should happen
IMO is that the backend will eventually reach the Closed state? Ie:
the frontend has initiated the disconnection from the backend by
setting the Closing state, and the backend will have to eventually
reach the Closed state.

At that point the frontend can initiate a reconnection by switching to
the Initialising state.

It's hard to tell exactly. I guess you would have to figure what makes
the frontend not get stuck at the same place as the first attempt.

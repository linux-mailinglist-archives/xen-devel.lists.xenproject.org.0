Wait - there are two aspects here: Vectors are difficult to be shared
on the same CPU (but it's not impossible if the devices and their
drivers meet certain conditions). But the bitmap gets installed as a
per-domain rather than a per-vcpu one, and using the same vector on
different CPUs is definitely possible, as demonstrated by both Xen
itself as well as Linux.

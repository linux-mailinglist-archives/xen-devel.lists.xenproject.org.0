What about systems without CPU policy in the migration stream, will
those also get restored as expected?

I think you likely need to check whether 'restore' is set and keep the
old logic in that case?

As otherwise migrated systems without a CPU policy will get the new
topology information instead of the old one?

This needs to be in the commit message IMO.

I think that's fine, but this divergence from current behavior of
cleaning the topology for the host policy needs to be mentioned in
the commit message.

Thanks, Roger.

Xen will need to parse the device-tree to find the mapping. So I am not 
entirely convinced there will be more complexity needed other than 
requiring a bitmap to know which vMasterID has been allocated.

That said, you would still need one to validate the input provided by 
the user. So overall maybe there will be no added complexity?

That would not be very different to how this works today for Zephyr. 
They need libxl to generate the guest DT.

That said, I agree this is a bit of a pain...

It sounds like what you want is creating something similar to libacpi 
but for Device-Tree. That should work with some caveats.

AFAICT, having the partial device-tree is not enough. You also need the 
real DT to figure out the pMaster-ID.

We would need an hypercall to retrieve the host Device-Tree. But that 
would not be too difficult to add.

If we use the concept of libacpi, we may not need a to have a 
stand-alone script. It could directly linked in libxl or any other tools.

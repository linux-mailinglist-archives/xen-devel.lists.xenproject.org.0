This series proposes a concrete version of the Xen Project
CoC based on v1.4 of the Contributor Covenant. See [1]

It also reflects the discussion in [2] and some private
discussions on IRC to identify initial members of the Xen
Projectâ€™s CoC team.

For convenence of review and in line with other policy documents
I created a git repository at [3]. This series can be found at [5].

The series is incomplete in that it does not yet contain the document
on positive behavior: this will be based on [4]. My intention is to
use a lightwight process based on
* Documentation to set expectations, share tips and best practices - with the
hope that people in the community reflect occasionally on how they are doing
against these (or are maybe prompted by peers to do so)
* A safe back-channel to ask for advice when a conversation becomes inefficient,
unactionable, is unfriendly, ... with a view to recover it
* Arbitration in cases where there is some friction amongst participants in a
discussion, which was not resolvable by any of the before. After all, when this
happens there is a risk that a working relationship gets negatively impacted. It
is actually in the interest of each participant to improve to avoid friction,
stress, etc.

I hope that we can approve the series without the first part, but I do not mind
if people feel this needs to be done in one go.

Right now, when a new series comes in it ends up in one big queue (xen-devel@). Most complex series have to go through a series of gates (aka code reviews from different people) before they get applied and when a new version comes out the series ends up in the queue again: each reviewer today prioritizes their own review queues, where no-one else sees the prioritisation of other reviewers. Unless there is lot of spare review capacity (which there isn't) we essentially end up in grid-lock, with an ever-growing queue. We seem to have specific additional complexity in Xen because most recent series, typically involve a large number of reviewers.

We could look at a model where the reviewers/committers agree that one takes the lead on reviewing a specific series. We could try and streamline the ownership structure to create a clearer mapping.

With  PR comment mirroring, the mailing list would remain the definitive archive of review comments.  There may also be opportunities for integration with Xen's Gitlab CI, e.g. series testing on multiple architectures.

Yes, this has been brought up in the past, and the majority (me
included) preferred doing doing reviews on a mailing list. However,
patchworks has been getting better and better and should now be able to
give you a github-like web interface to patch series submissions and
reviews while retaining the mailing list based workflow most still
prefer. I know patchworks has also been used to trigger testing by some.
I don't know the state of the patchworks instance for Xen.

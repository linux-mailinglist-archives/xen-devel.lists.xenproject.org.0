I feel like acpi_mmcfg_init() is an obscure place to do this.  It
won't be strange to shuffle that call around and forgot it's also
adding segment 0.

I would prefer if such allocation of segment 0 was done in
__start_xen(), as that makes it much easier to identify dependencies
and prevent such kind of re-ordering mistakes.

Thanks, Roger.

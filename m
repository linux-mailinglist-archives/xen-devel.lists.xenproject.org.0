Oh.Â  That is a bit awkward.

This is because there is no legitimate way to determine the end of the
instruction.

Most of the not_64bit instructions do have a well-defined end, even if
they aren't permitted for use.

I think there is a semantic difference between "we can't parse the
instruction", and "we can parse it, but it's not legitimate in this
context".

I don't think our exact split is correct, but I don't think moving all
#UD checking into x86_decode() is correct either.

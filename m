We should, yes. The one thing I'm a little uneasy with is the
new lock "variant" that gets introduced. Custom locking methods
also are a common source of problems (which isn't to say I see
any here).

It'll become less important, but not pointless - any unnecessary
locking would better be removed imo.

I'd also like to note that the non-straightforward locking rules
wouldn't really change with his series; the benefit there really
is the dropping of the need for IRQ-safe locking.

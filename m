To clarify, on arm64, the decision to enable the bulk of mitigation is 
done at runtime. The Kconfig is just to remove it from the binary if you 
you are not targeting such HW. With that in mind...

... do you mean always an errata enabled in the Kconfig would be always 
mitigate (IOW no runtime selection)?

So I have looked at the code and it is rather unclear why you actually 
need to disable CPU Errata. Can you clarify what would happen if 
cpuerrata is always built *and* CONFIG_ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICATOR is 
gated by HAS_VMAP? I am assuming we will not need the branch predictor 
hardening on Cortex-R (at least this is the implication from [1]).

Now regarding alternative, at least for arm64 this is used outside of 
the errata. Not critical right now, but at some point you will want to 
re-enable alternatives.

Cheers,

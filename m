Oh, OK. It was reported that HVM_PARAM_CALLBACK_TYPE_VECTOR doesn't
work well with migration and when using hardware APIC virtualization
IIRC, because of the fact that interrupts are not signaled in the
lapic and directly injected.

Oh, then there's definitely no legacy PIC at all. Writes to the PIC IO
ports will be dropped/ignored, and reads will return ~0. I guess you
could implement some check based on that in order to avoid doing any
initialization?

I don't think it should be harmful in any way, but you are just likely
spending a bunch of time trapping into the hypervisor to handle those
reads/writes for no good reason.

If you don't do any IO-APIC configuration at all then that's
completely fine.

No need to do that. There's no legacy PIC on PVH, and then event
channel interrupts are not routed through the PIC when using
HVM_PARAM_CALLBACK_TYPE_VECTOR.

There's also a periodic timer (see VCPUOP_{set/stop}_periodic_timer),
which was enabled by default at 100Hz for PV guests. This is not the
case for PVH.

I think you should best avoid clearing evtchn_upcall_pending here, as
Xen will then inject more vector callbacks if a new event is signaled,
even when you have not processed the previous one?

How is this cleared? It must be cleared before the handler is run, or
else you will likely miss interrupts.

Also, I think you could mask the port before setting
evtchn_callback_ml and unmask it when evtchn_callback_ml is cleared?

If you can dump the event channel numbers and their usage from Solo5
then you can check against the 'e' debug key from Xen in order to
check if there are indeed pending events to be delivered on some of
them.

Just checking the output from the 'e' debug key will tell you if
there's anything pending and if there are any channels masked.

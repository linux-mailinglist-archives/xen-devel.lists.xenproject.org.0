    xen/x86: switch to use generic implemetation of bug.h
    
    The following changes were made:
    * Make GENERIC_BUG_FRAME mandatory for X86
    * Update asm/bug.h using generic implementation in <xen/bug.h>
    * Update do_invalid_op using generic do_bug_frame()
    * Define BUG_DEBUGGER_TRAP_FATAL to debugger_trap_fatal(X86_EXC_GP,regs)
    * type of eip variable was changed to 'const void *'

    xen: change <asm/bug.h> to <xen/bug.h>
    
    The idea of the patch is to change all <asm/bug.h> to <xen/bug.h> and
    keep Xen compilable with adding only minimal amount of changes:
    1. It was added "#include <xen/types.h>" to ARM's "<asm/bug.h>" as it
      uses uint_{16,32}t in 'struct bug_frame'.
    2. It was added '#define BUG_FRAME_STRUCT' which means that ARM hasn't
      been switched to generic implementation yet.
    3. It was added '#define BUG_FRAME_STRUCT' which means that x86 hasn't
      been switched to generic implementation yet.
    4. BUGFRAME_* and _start_bug_frame[], _stop_bug_frame_*[] were removed
      for ARM & x86 to deal with compilation errors such as:
          redundant redeclaration of ...
    5. Remove BUG_DISP_WIDTH, BUG_LINE_LO_WIDTH, BUG_LINE_HI_WIDTH from
      x86's <asm.bug.h> to not to produce #undef for them and #define again
      with the same values as in <xen/bug.h>. These #undef and #define will
      be anyway removed in the patch [2]
    6. Remove <asm/bug.h> from <x86/acpi/cpufreq/cpufreq.c> and
      <drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c> as nothing from <xen/bug.h> are used in
      <*/cpufreq.c>
    
    In the following two patches x86 and ARM archictectures will be
    switched fully:
    [1] xen/arm: switch ARM to use generic implementation of bug.h
    [2] xen/x86: switch x86 to use generic implemetation of bug.h

    xen: introduce CONFIG_GENERIC_BUG_FRAME
    
    A large part of the content of the bug.h is repeated among all
    architectures, so it was decided to create a new config
    CONFIG_GENERIC_BUG_FRAME.
    
    The version of <bug.h> from x86 was taken as the base version.
    
    The patch introduces the following stuff:
      * common bug.h header
      * generic implementation of do_bug_frame
      * new config CONFIG_GENERIC_BUG_FRAME

    x86emul: move various utility functions to separate source files
    
    Many are needed by the hypervisor only - have one file for this purpose.
    Some are also needed by the harness (but not the fuzzer) - have another
    file for these.
    
    Code moved gets slightly adjusted in a few places, e.g. replacing
    "state" by "s" (like was done for other that has been split off).

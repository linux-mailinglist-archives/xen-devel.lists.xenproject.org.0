I agree that it would be good to have the support in upstream!

Linux provides earlyprintk facilities that can be used in Xen. To enable 
it, you need to have your kernel built with CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK=y and 
CONFIG_XEN=y. This can then be enabled by passing earlyprintk=xenboot on 
your command line.

Note that Linux needs to detect you are using Xen before using 
earlyprintk. If you need earlier, then what I usually do is hacking 
xen_raw_console_write() (in drivers/tty/hvc/hvc_xen.c) and replace 'if 
(xen_domain())' with 'if (1)'.

Right, 4.8.5 is now out of support and we improved Xen quite a lot since 
then. As a general recommendation, I would suggest to move the series to 
the latest staging once you get it working on 4.8.5.

However, I don't see any reason why 5.7 wouldn't boot on 4.8.5. I will 
have a look at your stack trace and answer there.

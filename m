Yeah, I had seen that. What I'm having trouble to understand is how the
OS will know to avoid that range for e.g. placing BARs.

The compiler ought to be able to fold this into a suitable constant
at the use site. Definitely not static imo, and I see little point
in making a local variable const, unless one really wants to
document something very special.

Oh, yes, that's easier possible now that the variable is static.

Well, okay. To be honest I'm not even sure why I did it this way, as
I could have expected a respective comment.

"Normal" extra pages have an owner, so no, there aren't any others.
If and when any appear, this may need further customizing, albeit
generally I'd hope further pages matching this pattern would also
want similar treatment.

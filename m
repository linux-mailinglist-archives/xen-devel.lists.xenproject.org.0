Please bear with me, but I'm still uncertain.

Even if IBRS is not enabled, and such indirect branch predictions are
at the same predictor mode, how would that be of any use to a guest?
My understanding was that the attacker is the one that has to control
the indirect branch predictor contents in order to attack the
hypervisor or other guests.

Hm, we do seem to already use MSR_PRED_CMD with such lists, so I would
assume they work just fine.

Anyway, was mostly a recommendation towards clarity, because I think
the return to guest context assembly is getting rather convoluted, and
it's IMO critical for it to be easy to follow.

Thanks, Roger.

I too did consider something like this. While I'm not opposed, it
effectively requires well-behaved consumers who haven't been well-
behaved in the past.

Probably. Would need trying out on the affected older version,
just like ...

... doing this would need to. Iirc I did add the write side of the
handling in my patch just for symmetry. I'd prefer handling to be
symmetric, but I can see why we may not want it to be so.

Indeed. I would always recommend user to use virtio-net over eepro1000.

We need to be clear about what we are exposing to the guest. With this 
patch we will describe a PCI hostbridge in Device Tree (well it is an 
empty region we hope the Device Model to emulate at some point). But the 
hypervisor will not create the device model. Instead, you expect the 
user/integrator to have extra script to launch a Device Model (So it may 
not even be a hostbridge).

It is nice to have a cut down version of QEMU :). However, Xen doesn't 
care about the device model used for the emulation. I have seen some 
specialized DM in the wild (and used them while I was working on 
disaggregating the DM).

Anyway, while I understand this approach works in tailored environment, 
I am not convinced this works for a more general approach. The two 
options I would rather consider are:
   1. Allow the device model to receive access for a single PCI device 
(IOW hook into vPCI).
   2. Find a way to let the user provide the binding (maybe in a partial 
device-tree) + the list of Interrupts/MMIO that would be emulated by QEMU.

The second approach might be another way to get a second hostbridge in 
your use case while giving a bit more flexibility in what can be done 
(thinking about disagreggated environment).

Cheers,

Yes I am referring to balloon in/out.

So long you are not using the solution in prod then you are fine (see 
below)... But then we should make clear this feature is a tech preview.

So we are not creating the hypervisor node in the DT for dom0less domU. 
However, the hypercalls are still accessible by a domU if it really
wants to use them.

Therefore, a guest can easily mess up with your static configuration and 
predictability.

IMHO, this is a must to solve before "static memory" can be used in 
production.

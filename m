I haven't tried and I don't know whether we have UEFI system on x86.

I am not in favor of this approach. There are no reason for this to be 
x86-only aside there is a bug in the code.

AFAICT, this is always an issue on Arm (both QEMU and Softiron fails to 
boot). It still not clear whether it might fail on some x86 systems. So 
we first need to figure out what's happening.

I am planning to spend some time on it today (as a low priority).

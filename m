As discussed yesterda, I tweaked a bit switch_ttbr(). Below the version 
I plan to use:

         /* 1) Ensure any previous read/write have completed */
         dsb   sy /* XXX: Can this be a ish? */
         isb

         /* 2) Turn off MMU */
         mrs    x1, SCTLR_EL2
         bic    x1, x1, #SCTLR_Axx_ELx_M
         msr    SCTLR_EL2, x1
         isb

         /*
          * 3) Flush the TLBs.
          * See asm/arm64/flushtlb.h for the explanation of the sequence.
          */
         dsb   nshst
         tlbi  alle2
         dsb   nsh
         isb

         /* 4) Update the TTBR */
         msr   TTBR0_EL2, x0
         isb

         /* 5) Turn on the MMU */
         mrs   x1, SCTLR_EL2
         orr   x1, x1, #SCTLR_Axx_ELx_M  /* Enable MMU */
         msr   SCTLR_EL2, x1
         isb

         ret

Cheers,

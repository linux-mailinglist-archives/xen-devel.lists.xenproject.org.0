It would seem fishy behavior to me for the hardware to continue
issuing prefetches against a page that has just been noticed to
cause issues when accessed. Surely hardware at least _could_
internally mark such a page #UC or some such, to prevent further
prefetches to actually hit the bus.

But getting something printed is magnitudes better that hanging
or rebooting entirely silently.

Nevertheless, as long as you extend the description somewhat to
express this reasoning in some way

(a little hesitantly though).

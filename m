Honestly, this is what I meant by stating that the asymmetry is a total
mess.

I originally named all 'remote', but this is even less accurate, it may
still contain the current cpu.

Our matrix of complexity:

* FLUSH_TLB for L2+ structure changes
* FLUSH_TLB_GLOBAL/FLUSH_ROOT_PGTBL for XPTI

with optimisations to skip GLOBAL/ROOT_PGTBL on the local CPU if none of
the updates hit the L4-in-use, and to skip the remote if we hold all
references on the L4.

Everything is complicated because pt_owner may not be current, for
toolstack operations constructing a new domain.

No - that was accidental, while attempting to reduce the diff.

See above.Â  remote is even more confusing than all.

This transformation should not be recommended in general.Â  There are
cases, including this one, where it is at best, no effect, and at worst,
wrong.

I don't care about people using ancient compilers.Â  They've got far
bigger (== more impactful) problems than (the absence of) this
transformation, and the TLB flush will dwarf anything the compiler does
here.

However, the hand "optimised" case breaks a compiler spotting that the
entire second clause is actually redundant for now.

I specifically didn't encode the dependency, to avoid subtle bugs
if/when someone alters the logic.

Its faster in all cases, even low CPU counts.

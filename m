I'm not mixing the two, no; the two are still insufficiently disentangled.
There's really no reason (long term) to have both host policy and
x86_capabilities. Therefore I'd prefer if new code (including a basically
fundamental re-write as is going to be needed for nested) to avoid
needlessly further extending x86_capabilities. Unless of course there's
something fundamentally wrong with eliminating the redundancy, which
likely Andrew would be in the best position to point out.

Can as well reply here then, rather than there: If the movement from
host to HVM policy was done first, the patch here could more sanely go
on top, and patch 2 could then also go on top, converting the separate
variable to host policy accesses, quite possibly introducing a similar
wrapper as you introduce there right now.

But no, I'm not meaning to make this a requirement; this would merely be
an imo better approach. My ack there stands, in case you want to keep
(and commit) the change as is.

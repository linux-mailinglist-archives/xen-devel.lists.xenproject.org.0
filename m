Yup, IIRC that's why Ray said it was much more easier for them to
support VirtIO GPUs from a PVH dom0 rather than classic PV one.

It might be easier to implement from a classic PV dom0 if there's
pv-iommu support, so that dom0 can create it's own contiguous memory
buffers from the device PoV.

As a note here, changing the type to MMIO would likely involve
modifying the EPT/NPT tables to propagate the new type.  On a PVH dom0
this would likely involve shattering superpages in order to set the
correct memory types.

Depending on how often and how random those system RAM changes are
necessary this could also create contention on the p2m lock.

Maybe.  The fact the guest needs to balloon down that amount of memory
seems weird to me, as from the guest PoV that mapped memory is
MMIO-like and not system RAM.

Thanks, Roger.

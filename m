Such removal is what, in the post commit message remark, I'm referring to
as "moving to too lax". Doing so might be okay, but will imo be hard to
prove to be correct for all possible cases. Along these lines goes also
that I'm adding the IOMMU-enabled and cache-flush checks: In principle
p2m_mmio_direct should not be used when neither of these return true. Yet
a similar consideration would apply to the immediately subsequent if().

Removing this code would, in particular, result in INVALID_MFN getting a
type of WB by way of the subsequent if(), unless the type there would
also be p2m_mmio_direct (which, as said, it ought to never be for non-
pass-through domains). That again _may_ not be a problem as long as such
EPT entries would never be marked present, yet that's again difficult to
prove.

I was in fact wondering whether to special-case INVALID_MFN in the change
I'm making. Question there is: Are we sure that by now we've indeed got
rid of all arithmetic mistakenly done on MFN variables happening to hold
INVALID_MFN as the value? IOW I fear that there might be code left which
would pass in INVALID_MFN masked down to a 2M or 1G boundary. At which
point checking for just INVALID_MFN would end up insufficient. If we
meant to rely on this (tagging possible leftover issues as bugs we don't
mean to attempt to cover for here anymore), then indeed the mfn_valid()
check could be replaced by a comparison with INVALID_MFN (following a
pattern we've been slowly trying to carry through elsewhere, especially
in shadow code). Yet it could still not be outright dropped imo.

Furthermore simply dropping (or replacing as per above) that check won't
work either: Further down in the function we use mfn_to_page(), which
requires an up-front mfn_valid() check. That said, this code looks
partly broken to me anyway: For a 1G page mfn_valid() on the start of it
doesn't really imply all parts of it are valid. I guess I need to make a
2nd patch to address that as well, which may then want to be a prereq
change to the one here (if we decided to go the route you're asking for).

Oh, indeed, I should have dug out when this broke. I didn't because I
knew this mfn_valid() check was there forever, neglecting that it wasn't
always (almost) first.

Two corrections here: First iPAT is a boolean; it can't be set to WB.
And then what was happening prior to that change was that for the APIC
access page iPAT was set to true, thus forcing WB there. iPAT was left
set to false for all other p2m_mmio_direct pages, yielding (PAT-
overridable) UC there.

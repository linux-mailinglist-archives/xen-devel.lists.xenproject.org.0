Please bear with me, as I'm not sure if your question was because you
think the paragraph is not clear and/or should be expanded.

The point of the paragraph you mention was to have a difference
between guests running in shadow mode vs guests running in HAP mode.
Maybe I should use guest loaded page pages, to differentiate between
guest created page tables and the page tables actually loaded in cr3
in guest mode?

The memory management code in PV guests also needs to perform TLB
flushes, so I wasn't sure whether the aim was to also switch it to use
guest_flush_tlb_mask.

I guess this doesn't make a lot of sense since PV guests just need a
plain TLB flush, and there's not a lot of benefit from having a helper
around that. Maybe for PV guests running in XPTI mode, where the flush
can be avoided as the return to guest path already flushes the page
tables? Anyway, will remove the is_pv_domain check.

Thanks, Roger.

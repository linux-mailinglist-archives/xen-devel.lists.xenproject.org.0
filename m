Thank you for putting things together here and valuable input. As for 
me, the "virtio-mmio & MSI solution" as a performance improvement sounds 
indeed
interesting. Flipping through the virtio-mmio links I found a discussion 
regarding that [1].
I think this needs an additional investigation and experiments, however 
I am not sure there is an existing infrastructure in Xen on Arm to do so.
Once we make some progress with the IOREQ series I would be able to 
focus on enhancements which we would consider worthwhile.

I will look at it.

CONFIG_IOREQ_SERVER is not protected by CONFIG_XEN_EXPERT. I mentioned 
how to enable CONFIG_IOREQ_SERVER on Arm (since it is disabled by 
default within this series) when
describing how test this series to Masami, but forgot to add here. Could 
you apply the one-line patch [2] and rebuild. Sorry for inconvenience.

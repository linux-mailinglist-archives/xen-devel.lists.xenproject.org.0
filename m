That old code was especially dumb even before retpoline.Â  See also the
damage caused by c/s 245a320ce2.

Yes, we are relying on the compiler not to do transformations behind our
backs, but it won't of its own accord.

That sounds like a broken compiler.

There are legal cases where a direct call has to turn into an indirect
one, and that's when we need to traverse more than disp32 distance.

But without going to a larger mcmodel, we'd get linker errors before
that becomes a problem, because R_X86_64_PLT32 relocations can't be
retrofitted into an indirect call at link time.

That would be one for the clang and gcc developers.

I don't see a plausible problem here.

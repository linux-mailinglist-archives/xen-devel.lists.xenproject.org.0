Okay, so we seem to be hitting two previously noticed issues, neither
of which so far was necessary to address directly (because there was
always something else to be tweaked such that the problems went away).

For one, the boot CPU has a TSC value that lags by more than a
second compared to all secondary CPUs. The way
time_calibration_tsc_rendezvous() works, together with the way we
calculate system time from the TSC (get_s_time_fixed() - this is
where the known issue here is: the function breaks when trying to
scale a negative delta, hence the absurdly high s= values in the
screenshots you've provided), allows for small negative deltas
between CPUs, but expects to bring all CPUs' TSCs forward (i.e. over
the 1s interval between rendezvous' the lagging CPUs are assumed to
have made enough progress to be ahead of the more towards the future
timestamps on the previous run). Secondary lagging behind the boot
CPU more than this could also be dealt with, but on your system the
situation is the other way around.

Btw - what kind of BIOS do you have on this system? This way of the
TSCs being set is pretty odd, and must be - unless you run other
pre-boot software or an unusual boot loader - caused by the BIOS.

And then this points out (again, afaic at least) that the way we
kickstart the rendezvous handling is likely inappropriate.
Especially when TSCs are skewed like they are here, it is unhelpful
to launch Dom0 before having brought the TSC in sync. (Related to
this, I also don't think we should arm the respective timer before
AP bringup was done, or else we risk the first rendezvous instance
to not hit all CPUs.)

I'll work on addressing both, hoping that in particular for the
first one you'll be ready to help with testing (through perhaps
multiple iterations).

I _think_ you'd be running into trouble if you removed dom0_vcpus_pin
(which imo really no-one should use without reporting a bug, despite
all the hits to the contrary that one gets when searching the web),
and if you ran any guests (PV at least) without pinning their vCPU-s
to pCPU-s.

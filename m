Hi,

(+ Oleksii as the release manager)

Chiming into the discussion as there seems there is disagreement.

I agree we need consistency on how we handle security policy event 
channel. Although, I don't have a strong opinion on which way to go.

For the commit message, it is not entirely clear what "broke lseventch 
in dom0" really mean. Is it lsevtchn would not stop or it will just not 
display the event channel?

If the former, isn't a sign that the tool needs to be harden a bit more? 
If the latter, then I would argue that consistency for the XSM policy is 
more important than displaying the event channel for now (the patch was 
also committed 3 years ago...).

So I would vote for a revert and, if desired, replacing with a patch 
that would change the XSM policy consistently. Alternatively, the 
consistency should be a blocker for Xen 4.19.

Indeed, this is rule 4 of the check-in policy:

4. There must be no "open" objections.

I don't view Jan's objections as unreasonable in particular for the 
consistency part.

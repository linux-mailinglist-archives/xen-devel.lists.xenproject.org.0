You don't need the interrupts to read the perf counters. But AFAIU, you 
would have to poll at a regular interval yourself. There is also the 
question on how to catch the overflow?

I have to disagree with that. There are valid use-cases where you may 
want to expose the PMU for using perf to a single domain because you 
know it is safe to do so. I appreciate this is may not be the use case 
for your users (yet), but I have seen (and used) it on x86. So to me 
this approach is short-sighed.

TBH, this is not the first time I have seen patch for "let's expose the 
same feature to everyone because this is easy to do" and really dislike 
it. Exposing a new feature from the toolstack is easier than you think 
(baring the lack of reviews), this is a matter of creating a new flag a 
new option. This would make Xen a lot more flexible and enable more users...

So as it stands:

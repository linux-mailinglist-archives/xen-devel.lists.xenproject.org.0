+# Communication Guide
+
+We believe that our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) can help create a
+harassment-free environment, but is not sufficient to create a welcoming
+environment on its own. We can all make mistakes: when we do, we take
+responsibility for them and try to improve.
+
+This document lays out our gold standard, best practices for some common
+situations and mechanisms to help resolve issues that can have a
+negative effect on our community.
+
+## Goal
+
+We want a productive, welcoming and agile community that can welcome new
+ideas in a complex technical field which is able to reflect on and improve how
+we work.
+
+## Communication & Handling Differences in Opinions
+
+Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
+include:
+* Use welcoming and inclusive language
+* Keep discussions technical and actionable
+* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
+* Be aware of your own and counterpartâ€™s communication style and culture
+* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
+* Focus on what is best for the community
+* Show empathy towards other community members
+* Resolve differences in opinion effectively
+
+## Getting Help
+
+When developing code collaboratively, technical discussion and disagreements
+are unavoidable. Our contributors come from different countries and cultures,
+are driven by different goals and take pride in their work and in their point
+of view. This invariably can lead to lengthy and unproductive debate,
+followed by indecision, sometimes this can impact working relationships
+or lead to other issues that can have a negative effect on our community.
+
+To minimize such issue, we provide a 3-stage process
+* Self-help as outlined in this document
+* Ability to ask for an independent opinion or help in private
+* Mediation between parties which disagree. In this case a neutral community
+  member assists the disputing parties resolve the issues or will work with the
+  parties such that they can improve future interactions.
+
+If you need and independent opinion or help, feel free to contact
+mediation@xenproject.org. The team behind mediation@ is made up of the
+same community members as those listed in the Conduct Team: see
+[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). In addition, team members are obligated
+to maintain confidentiality with regard discussions that take place. If you
+have concerns about any of the members of the mediation@ alias, you are
+welcome to contact precisely the team member(s) of your choice. In this case,
+please make certain that you highlight the nature of a request by making sure
+that either help or mediation is mentioned in the e-mail subject or body.
+
+## Specific Topics and Best Practice
+
+* [Code Review Guide](code-review-guide.md):
+  Essential reading for code reviewers and contributors
+* [Communication Best Practice](communication-practice.md):
+  This guide covers communication guidelines for code reviewers and reviewees.
+  It should help you create self-awareness, anticipate, avoid  and help resolve
+  communication issues.
+* [Resolving Disagreement](resolving-disagreement.md):
+  This guide lays out common situations that can lead to dead-lock and shows
+  common patterns on how to avoid and resolve issues.

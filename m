Exactly my thinking! Except that now it gets called 10x times with
dom0less boot :-(

I understand the idea of passing NULL instead of "leaf", but I tried
having a look and I can't tell what we would be able to skip in
get_parent_handle.

Should we have a global variable to keep the dir_handle open during
dom0less module loading?

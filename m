My current plan for Arm is to issue the hypercall as part of an 
earlyinit call. But we can do much earlier (i.e. xen_early_init() which 
is called from setup_arch()) if necessary.

This should be early enough for Arm. How about x86?

So for Arm, we are only caring about XEN_VGATYPE_EFI_LFB. I wasn't sure 
what would be your need on x86. Hence, why I keep it.

If you don't need then, then I am happy to trim the structure for the 
new hypercall.

Just to clarify, are you suggesting to only pass video_lfb? IOW, we will 
always assume it is an EFI framebuffer and not pass the video_type.

I understand this is useful for some setup and I am not trying to say we 
should not have a way to expose the PMU (even unsafely) in upstream. 
However, I think the option as it stands is too wide (this should be a 
per domain knob) and we should properly expose the PMU (interrupts, 
bindings...).

Right, this would require a lot more work than what I wrote before.

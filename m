This is compare to?

Arm provides instructions to broadcast TLB flush, so by the time one of 
instruction is completed there is all the TLB entry associated to the 
translation doesn't exist.

I don't think using PV or shadow would change anything here in the way 
we do the flush.

So if I understand correctly, the HW may raise a fault even if the 
mapping was in the page-tables. Is it correct?

We have a spurious page fault handler for stage-2 (aka EPT on x86) as we 
need to have an invalid mapping to transition for certain page-tables 
update (e.g. superpage shattering). We are using the same rwlock with 
the page fault handler and the page-table update, so there is no way the 
two can run concurrently.

Hmmm, based on what I wrote above, I don't think this name would be more 
suitable. However, regardless the name, it is not clear to me when a 
caller should use false or true.

Have you considered a rwlock to synchronize the two?

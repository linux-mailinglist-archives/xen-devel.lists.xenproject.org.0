For one I'm unconvinced this is "must"; I think it is "may". We're
producing excess interrupts for an unaware guest, aiui. Presumably most
guests can tolerate this, but - second - it may be unnecessary overhead.
Which in turn may be why nobody has complained so far, as this sort of
overhead my be hard to notice. I also suspect the RTC may not be used
very often for generating a periodic interrupt. (I've also not seen the
flag named "RTC good" - the ACPI constant is ACPI_WAET_RTC_NO_ACK, for
example.)

A fair part of my confusion was about "&& !pt->priv". I've looked back
at 9607327abbd3 ("x86/HVM: properly handle RTC periodic timer even when
!RTC_PIE"), where this was added. It was, afaict, to cover for
hpet_set_timer() passing NULL with RTC_IRQ. Which makes me suspect that
be07023be115 ("x86/vhpet: add support for level triggered interrupts")
may have subtly broken things.

Not sure yet - as per above I'm still not convinced this part of the
change is correct.

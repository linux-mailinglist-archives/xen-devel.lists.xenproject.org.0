As Rahul is on leave:
I'm ok to introduce XEN_SYSCTL_PHYSCAP_vpci. I did the same for vpmu so it's ok.
However the problem I have is about setting this cap.
On arm it is easy as we are not supporting vpci at the moment so the cap can be set to false.
But how to deal with this cap in x86 code? I'm not familiar with x86 so I'm asking for advice.

Cheers,
Michal

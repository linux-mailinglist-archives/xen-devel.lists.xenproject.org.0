Let me say this explanation is not to say no but to give context to the
concerns. Forms of deprive/demote were considered though when
considering the concept proposed was to change the security model where
the hypervisor/idle domain were now explicitly being give a new security
context, is_privileged and xenboot_t, under which setup is being run.
This new xsm hook is to provide a transition point for the XSM policies
to set what the running security context should be for the
hypervisor/idle domain. The name xsm_transition_running() clearly
denotes when/where this hook should be used, where as the name
xsm_depriv_current() is more generic and another developer may attempt
to use it in a manner it was not intended.

It is possible to consider creating an xsm_depriv_current() that
functions in a more generic manner but will likely be more complicated
to support general usage, especially for flask where a flask specific
"lower" security context must be provided.

If there is still a preference towards xsm_depriv_current() while
maintaining the current mechanics as it makes more sense for the
majority, I have no issue with that.

Are you thinking along the lines of,

    if ( (!d->is_privileged) || (d->domain_id != DOMID_IDLE)
        panic("some message\n");

or is your concern more of,

    if ( !d->is_privileged )
        return;

In my mind the former is legitimate because execution should only arrive
here with current->domain being the idle domain and is_privileged set to
true. The latter check I feel is extraneous because 1) this hook should
only ever be called under the idle domain, thus it should be checked
first and should absolutely panic if another domain context is in place.
Which leads to, 2) checking if it is not false before setting to false
is only protecting against resetting to false for which there could be
no side effects this guard would be protecting against.

v/r,
dps

Honestly they look both very reasonable and I would be happy with either
of them. I agree with you and Ian that it would be best not to wait for
months, but to try to get it adopted soon.

It is surprising how few changes you had to make to the Contributor
Covenant baseline. Also both end results look so similar that I can
hardly distinguish them in terms of content.

A couple of comments on the Contributor Covenant based one:
- not sure if we still need the examples of positive behavior under "Our
  Standards" by they don't hurt
- Under "Our Responsibilites" the text keeps repeating "Project
  maintainers" while actually we probably want to mention the CoC team
  also (for instance "and are expected, together with the CoC team, to
  take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to").

At this point I might be tempted to suggest to use the one based on the
Contributor Covenant just because the changes are fewer, but I am happy
to leave the decision to you and what you think is best.

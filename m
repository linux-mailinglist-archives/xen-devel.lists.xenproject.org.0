The problem with such false positive warning messages is that
they'll cause cautious people to investigate, i.e. spend perhaps
a sizable amount of time in understanding what was actually a non-
issue. I view this as a problem, even if the code's functioning is
fine the way it is. I'm not even sure explicitly mentioning the
situation in the comment is going to help, as one may not stumble
across that comment while investigating.

I agree with the "shorter" aspect. What I'm afraid of is that someone may,
despite the comment, think the !! is a stray leftover from the bool_t
days. I'd therefore prefer to keep the !! pattern for just the legacy
uses, and see casts used in cases like the one here. However, if both you
and Andrew think otherwise, so be it.

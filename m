Right, but where's the difference to writes here happening when
!msix->enabled? All I'm saying is that all possible cases leading
to the "else" of this "if" need to be equally considered. Hence
my alternative patch.

It is under the assumption that msix_write() behaves correctly.
What I was saying is that there might appear to be a need to
set ->updated in msix_write() (to make sure the mask bit change
won't get lost), at which point the logic in control_write()
would need adjustment. Which I find undesirable.

I don't see this being a solution - we'd still end up calling
vpci_msix_arch_mask_entry() when !msix->enabled or msix->masked.

Ah yes, pirq_info() would return NULL here. Am I reading this as a
suggestion to simply drop the ASSERT(), instead of replacing it by
an if()? It would feel slightly more robust to me to keep the if().

I wasn't meaning to suggest we implement any of this without need.
I was, however, thinking we ought to at least check the high 12
address bits, and avoid trying to interpret the low 20 ones if
they don't match. Let me add a patch to this effect to the small
series that I've already accumulated anyway.

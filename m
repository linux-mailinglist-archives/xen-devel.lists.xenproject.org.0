Subject: [PATCH v2 3/3] svm/nestedsvm: Introduce nested capabilities bit
Date: Wed, 13 Mar 2024 12:24:54 +0000
Message-Id: <20240313122454.965566-4-george.dunlap@cloud.com>

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In order to make implementation and testing tractable, we will require
specific host functionality.  Add a nested_virt bit to hvm_funcs.caps,
and return an error if a domain is created with nested virt and this
bit isn't set.  Create VMX and SVM callbacks to be executed from
start_nested_svm(), which is guaranteed to execute after all
command-line options have been procesed.

For VMX, start with always enabling it if HAP is present; this
shouldn't change current behvior.

For SVM, require some basic functionality, adding a document
explaining the rationale.

NB that only SVM CPUID bits 0-7 have been considered.  Bits 10-16 may
be considered in a follow-up patch.

v2:
 - Fixed typo in title
 - Added hvm_nested_virt_supported() def for !CONFIG_HVM
 - Rebased over previous changes
 - Tweak some wording in document
 - Require npt rather than nrips twice
 - Remove stray __init from header
 - Set caps.nested_virt from callback from nestedhvm_setup()

+# Nested SVM (AMD) CPUID requirements
+
+The first step in making nested SVM production-ready is to make sure
+that all features are implemented and well-tested.  To make this
+tractable, we will initially be limiting the "supported" range of
+nested virt to a specific subset of host and guest features.  This
+document describes the criteria for deciding on features, and the
+rationale behind each feature.
+
+For AMD, all virtualization-related features can be found in CPUID
+leaf 8000000A:edx
+
+# Criteria
+
+- Processor support: At a minimum we want to support processors from
+  the last 5 years.  All things being equal, we'd prefer to cover
+  older processors than not.  Bits 0:7 were available in the very
+  earliest processors; and even through bit 15 we should be pretty
+  good support-wise.
+
+- Faithfulness to hardware: We need the behavior of the "virtual cpu"
+  from the L1 hypervisor's perspective to be as close as possible to
+  the original hardware.  In particular, the behavior of the hardware
+  on error paths 1) is not easy to understand or test, 2) can be the
+  source of surprising vulnerabiliies.  (See XSA-7 for an example of a
+  case where subtle error-handling differences can open up a privilege
+  escalation.)  We should avoid emulating any bit of the hardware with
+  complex error paths if we can at all help it.
+
+- Cost of implementation: We want to minimize the cost of
+  implementation (where this includes bringing an existing sub-par
+  implementation up to speed).  All things being equal, we'll favor a
+  configuration which does not require any new implementation.
+
+- Performance: All things being equal, we'd prefer to choose a set of
+  L0 / L1 CPUID bits that are faster than slower.
+
+
+# Bits
+
+- 0 `NP` *Nested Paging*: Required both for L0 and L1.
+
+  Based primarily on faithfulness and performance, as well as
+  potential cost of implementation.  Available on earliest hardware,
+  so no compatibility issues.
+
+- 1 `LbrVirt` *LBR / debugging virtualization*: Require for L0 and L1.
+
+  For L0 this is required for performance: There's no way to tell the
+  guests not to use the LBR-related registers; and if the guest does,
+  then you have to save and restore all LBR-related registers on
+  context switch, which is prohibitive.  Furthermore, the additional
+  emulation risks a security-relevant difference to come up.
+
+  Providing it to L1 when we have it in L0 is basically free, and
+  already implemented.
+
+  Just require it and provide it.
+
+- 2 `SVML` *SVM Lock*: Not required for L0, not provided to L1
+
+  Seems to be aboult enabling an operating system to prevent "blue
+  pill" attacks against itself.
+
+  Xen doesn't use it, nor provide it; so it would need to be
+  implementend.  The best way to protect a guest OS is to leave nested
+  virt disabled in the tools.
+
+- 3 `NRIPS` NRIP Save: Require for both L0 and L1
+
+  If NRIPS is not present, the software interrupt injection
+  functionality can't be used; and Xen has to emulate it.  That's
+  another source of potential security issues.  If hardware supports
+  it, then providing it to guest is basically free.
+
+- 4 `TscRateMsr`: Not required by L0, not provided to L1
+
+  The main putative use for this would be trying to maintain an
+  invariant TSC across cores with different clock speeds, or after a
+  migrate.  Unlike others, this doesn't have an error path to worry
+  about compatibility-wise; and according to tests done when nestedSVM
+  was first implemented, it's actually faster to emliate TscRateMSR in
+  the L0 hypervisor than for L1 to attempt to emulate it itself.
+
+  However, using this properly in L0 will take some implementation
+  effort; and composing it properly with L1 will take even more
+  effort.  Just leave it off for now.
+
+ - 5 `VmcbClean`: VMCB Clean Bits: Not required by L0, provide to L1
+
+  This is a pure optimization, both on the side of the L0 and L1.  The
+  implementaiton for L1 is entirely Xen-side, so can be provided even
+  on hardware that doesn't provide it.  And it's purely an
+  optimization, so could be "implemented" by ignoring the bits
+  entirely.
+
+  As such, we don't need to require it for L0; and as it's already
+  implemented, no reason not to provide it to L1.  Before this feature
+  was available those bits were marked SBZ ("should be zero"); setting
+  them was already advertised to cause unpredictable behavior.
+
+- 6 `FlushByAsid`: Require for L0, provide to L1
+
+  This is cheap and easy to use for L0 and to provide to the L1;
+  there's no reson not to just pass it through.
+
+- 7 `DecodeAssists`: Require for L0, provide to L1
+
+  Using it in L0 reduces the chance that we'll make some sort of error
+  in the decode path.  And if hardware supports it, it's easy enough
+  to provide to the L1.

This statement is correct.

I agree that if EL1 supports AArch32, then it means EL0 will not support.

However, if EL1 doesn't support AArch32, then it doesn't imply that EL0 
will not support AArch32.

Therefore, the check suggested would not be correct because it would 
prevent 32-bit userspace running on HW (such as IIRC Cortex-A76) that 
only support AArch32 in EL0.

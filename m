Uhmm... I underlook the fact we must preserve the current accessors for
the common fields.

I guess something like the following could do (completely untested,
hopefully should illustrate the idea):

struct ubuf_info {
	struct_group_tagged(ubuf_info_common, common,
		void (*callback)(struct sk_buff *, struct ubuf_info *,
                         bool zerocopy_success);
		refcount_t refcnt;
	        u8 flags;
	);

	union {
                struct {
                        unsigned long desc;
                        void *ctx;
                };
                struct {
                        u32 id;
                        u16 len;
                        u16 zerocopy:1;
                        u32 bytelen;
                };
        };

        struct mmpin {
                struct user_struct *user;
                unsigned int num_pg;
        } mmp;
};

Then you should be able to:
- access ubuf_info->callback,Â 
- access the same field via ubuf_info->common.callback
- declare variables as 'struct ubuf_info_commom' with appropriate
contents.

WDYT?

Thanks,

Paolo

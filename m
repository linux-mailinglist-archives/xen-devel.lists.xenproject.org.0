But a hole being plugged can also imply that a page is being set
shareable by nominate_page, which will take the mem sharing page lock?

That would be the path: get_gfn_type_access -> __get_gfn_type_access
-> (hole found in p2m) -> mem_sharing_fork_page -> nominate_page (with
page not being shareable already).

It's likely I'm missing some bits, this is all quite complex.

Thanks, Roger.

Note that the disable_local_APIC() call in __stop_this_cpu() does also
call clear_local_APIC(), which will attempt to clear ESR also.

Further patches in the series prevent the error from triggering in the
first place, since an attempt is made to disable or mask all possible
external interrupt sources Xen knows about before doing AP shutdown.

Wondered the same, but I couldn't find any suitable commit.  It's been
like this forever as far as I can tell.  It's possible my previous
fixes for fixup_irqs() made this worse, but I don't think it was
correct to begin with.

I don't have a strong opinion.  I also looked it up and seemed to be
correct, but might not be fine to use in this context.

Thanks, Roger.

FTAOD, could you mention this in the commit message?

FreeBSD doesn't use `$qemuu_runvar` because it was always using QEMU
upstream (when the FreeBSD test was added we decided to only test with
QEMU upstream).  So there's indeed no `-qemut` variant, but by
dropping the -qemuu prefix it could be confused with a PV guest
based test.

Probably a dummy question, but why haven't those commits changed the
output of make-flight earlier?  I'm fine with the change, but I don't
really get why we are seeing it only now.

Thanks for the clarification.

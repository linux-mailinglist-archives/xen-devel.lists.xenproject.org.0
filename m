I wasn't necessarily thinking about a TLB flush but instead a DSB/DMB. 
At least for the MMU case, I think that in theory we need a DSB when the 
there is no TLB flush to ensure new entry in the page-tables are seen 
before p2m_write_unlock() completes.

So far we are getting away because write_pte() always have a barrier 
after. But at some point, I would like to remove it as this is a massive 
hammer.

See above. I am trying to understand the expected sequence when updating 
the MPU tables. Are you going to add barriers after every update to the 
entry?

Having an helper would also be a good place to explain why some 
synchronization is not needed. I am not sure about a name though.

Maybe p2m_sync() and p2m_force_sync()?

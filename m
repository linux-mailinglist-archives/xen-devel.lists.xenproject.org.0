Looking at the name of the functions, I would expect that we would need 
another code movement in the future to move back Arm specific function 
under arch/arm/. So we would end up with two code movement as well.

I would prefer if we wait until RISC-V/x86 needs it so we don't 
unnecessarily move Arm specific code in common/.

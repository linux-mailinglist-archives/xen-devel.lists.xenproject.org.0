Unbreaking is as easy as removing the command line option, or
adding "flask=disable" at the end of the command line.

Preventing to create guests is another option, but complicated
by the late-hwdom feature we still have - to achieve what you
want we'd have to permit creating that one further domain.
Dom0less perhaps also would need special treatment (and there
I'm not sure we'd know which of the domains we are supposed to
allow being created, and which one(s) not).

You didn't look at the patch then: I'm intentionally _not_
panic()-ing from the command line parsing function, but from
an initcall. Both VGA and serial have been set up by that time.
(I was in fact considering to pull it a little earlier, into
a pre-SMP initcall.)

I'm kind of lost here, what does signaling mean in this context?

I would expect the interrupt vector to not get set in IRR if the MSI-X
entry is masked, as at that point the state of the address/data fields
might not be consistent (that's the whole point of masking it right?)

My understanding was that the masking would prevent the message write to
the APIC from happening, and hence no vector should get set in IRR.

Right, and the vector change happens in ->set_affinity(), not
->enable().  See for example set_msi_affinity() and the
write_msi_msg(), that's where the vector gets changed.

Yeah, those I expect would be completed in the window between the
write of the new vector/destination and the reading of IRR.

Thanks, Roger.

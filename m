A couple of questions and the pdev_list_is_read_locked() needs a small
adjustment.

I'm confused by this comment, as I don't see why it matters that the
lock might be lock before returning.  We need to ensure the lock is
taken at the time of the assert, and hence pdev_list_is_read_locked()
can be used.

'd' is missing parentheses here, should be (d).

FWIW, if this is only intended to be used with ASSERT, it might as
well be an ASSERT itself:

ASSERT_PDEV_LIST_IS_READ_LOCKED(d) ...

Don't have a strong opinion, so I'm fine with how it's used, just
noting it might be clearer if it was an ASSERT_ right away.

Thanks, Roger.

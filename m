That's interesting, it seems to me that Linux is assuming that pages
at certain boundaries are superpages, and thus it can just increase
the mfn to get the next physical page.

It would be very interesting to figure out where those requests
originate, iow: which entity in Linux creates the bios with the
faulting address(es).

It's a wild guess, but could you try to boot Linux with swiotlb=force
on the command line and attempt to trigger the issue?  I wonder
whether imposing the usage of the swiotlb will surface the issues as
CPU accesses, rather then IOMMU faults, and that could get us a trace
inside Linux of how those requests are generated.

There's possibly some condition we are missing that causes a component
in Linux to assume the next address is mfn + 1, instead of doing the
full address translation from the linear or pfn space.

Thanks, Roger.

It's a question of taste TBH, I'm certainly not going to insist.

Since you have to wrap the line to fit in 80 cols anyway, I think I
would rather write: "This is a workaround for migrated domains. ...".
Current text reads to me as it's a migration bug, but that's not the
case, the bug is in the previous Xen versions.  I'm not a native
speaker anyway, so maybe it's just me reading it wrong.

I would just use interrupts FWIW.

Oh, I see.  Just printing the expected LDR then would be fine.

Thanks, Roger.

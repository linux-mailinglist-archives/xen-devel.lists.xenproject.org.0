Which may be a good thing for debugging purposes, because now we have
a way to investigate what is actually blocking the interrupt's
delivery without having to worry about more output screwing the
overall picture.

(XEN)    IRQ:  34 vec:59 IO-APIC-level   status=010 aff:{0}/{0-7} in-flight=1 d0: 34(-MM)

(XEN)     IRQ 34 Vec 89:
(XEN)       Apic 0x02, Pin  2: vec=59 delivery=LoPri dest=L status=1 polarity=1 irr=1 trig=L mask=0 dest_id:00000001

(XEN) ioapic 2 pin 2 gsi 34 vector 0x67
(XEN)   delivery mode 0 dest mode 0 delivery status 0
(XEN)   polarity 1 IRR 0 trig mode 1 mask 0 dest id 0

IOW from guest pov the interrupt is entirely idle (mask and irr clear),
while Xen sees it as both in-flight and irr also already having become
set again. I continue to suspect the EOI timer not doing its job. Yet
as said before, for it to have to do anything in the first place the
"guest" (really Dom0 here) would need to fail to EOI the IRQ within
the timeout period. Which in turn, given your description of how you
handle interrupts, cannot be excluded (i.e. the handling may simply
take "slightly" too long).

What we're missing is LAPIC information, since the masked status logged
is unclear: (-MM) isn't fully matching up with "mask=0". But of course
the former is just a software representation, while the latter is what
the RTE holds. IOW for the interrupt to not get delivered, there needs
to be this or a higher ISR bit set (considering we don't use the TPR),
or (I think we can pretty much exclude this) we'd need to be running
with IRQs off for extended periods of time.

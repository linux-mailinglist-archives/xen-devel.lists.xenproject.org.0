-.Sh DESCRIPTION
-These macros define and operate on four types of data structures:
-singly-linked lists, singly-linked tail queues, lists, and tail queues.
-All four structures support the following functionality:
-.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
-.It
-Insertion of a new entry at the head of the list.
-.It
-Insertion of a new entry after any element in the list.
-.It
-O(1) removal of an entry from the head of the list.
-.It
-Forward traversal through the list.
-.It
-Swawpping the contents of two lists.
-.El
-.Pp
-Singly-linked lists are the simplest of the four data structures
-and support only the above functionality.
-Singly-linked lists are ideal for applications with large datasets
-and few or no removals,
-or for implementing a LIFO queue.
-Singly-linked lists add the following functionality:
-.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
-.It
-O(n) removal of any entry in the list.
-.El
-.Pp
-Singly-linked tail queues add the following functionality:
-.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
-.It
-Entries can be added at the end of a list.
-.It
-O(n) removal of any entry in the list.
-.It
-They may be concatenated.
-.El
-However:
-.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
-.It
-All list insertions must specify the head of the list.
-.It
-Each head entry requires two pointers rather than one.
-.It
-Code size is about 15% greater and operations run about 20% slower
-than singly-linked lists.
-.El
-.Pp
-Singly-linked tailqs are ideal for applications with large datasets and
-few or no removals,
-or for implementing a FIFO queue.
-.Pp
-All doubly linked types of data structures (lists and tail queues)

- * This file defines four types of data structures: singly-linked lists,
- * singly-linked tail queues, lists and tail queues.
- *
- * A singly-linked list is headed by a single forward pointer. The elements
- * are singly linked for minimum space and pointer manipulation overhead at
- * the expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements. New elements can be
- * added to the list after an existing element or at the head of the list.
- * Elements being removed from the head of the list should use the explicit
- * macro for this purpose for optimum efficiency. A singly-linked list may
- * only be traversed in the forward direction.  Singly-linked lists are ideal
- * for applications with large datasets and few or no removals or for
- * implementing a LIFO queue.
- *
- * A singly-linked tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the
- * head of the list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are
- * singly linked for minimum space and pointer manipulation overhead at the
- * expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements. New elements can be added
- * to the list after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the
- * end of the list. Elements being removed from the head of the tail queue
- * should use the explicit macro for this purpose for optimum efficiency.
- * A singly-linked tail queue may only be traversed in the forward direction.
- * Singly-linked tail queues are ideal for applications with large datasets
- * and few or no removals or for implementing a FIFO queue.
- *
- * A list is headed by a single forward pointer (or an array of forward
- * pointers for a hash table header). The elements are doubly linked
- * so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
- * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before
- * or after an existing element or at the head of the list. A list
- * may only be traversed in the forward direction.
- *
- * A tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
- * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
- * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
- * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or
- * after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of
- * the list. A tail queue may be traversed in either direction.
- *
- * For details on the use of these macros, see the queue(3) manual page.

How about using %zu rather than a cast here?

I can't find any answer on my question about this part. I understand the 
code would be buggy if this happen, but is it warrant to crash the host? 
Couldn't you just return an error and continue to run?

This is confusing, why would you need to reset c->desc.length but not 
the rest of the fields?

This suggests you know in advance the size of the record. I have seen 
some cases where we don't know the size in advance. A good example if 
when saving grants. You know the maximum of grant used by the guest but 
you don't know yet the number of grants used. You might need to walk the 
"list" twice or allocate a temporary buffer. None of them are ideal.

Another example is when saving memory, we may want to compact page 
informations to save space.

This problem is going to be more relevant for LiveUpdate where we need 
to be able to create the stream in a very short amount of time. 
Allocating any temporary buffer and/or walking the list twice is going 
to kill the performance.

I would suggest to consider a different approach where you update the 
record length at the end.

FWIW, this below the current approach for the LU stream (IIRC David sent 
a prototype recently). A record is opened using lu_stream_open_record(), 
you then have two way to add data:
     - lu_stream_append() -> This takes a buffer and write to the stream.
     - lu_stream_reserve() -> Pre-allocate space in the stream and 
return a pointer to the beginning of the reserved region.
     - lu_stream_end_reservation() -> Takes the actual size in parameter 
and update the stream size.
     - lu_stream_close_record() -> Update the header with the total 
length and update the position in the stream.

I noticed that all the pasding check have been dropped. I still think we 
need implicit padding to harden the code.

I can't find an answer to my question about d->is_dying. What if the 
guest die afterwards? What does protect us against domain_kill()?

Same here.

I haven't seen any answer about xen version here. For the record:

"Let's imagine in 4.14 we introduced a bug in the saving part. This is
solved in 4.15 but somehow the version is not bumped. How would you
differentiate the streams saved by Xen 4.14 so you can still migrate?

If you record the version of Xen in the record automatically, then you
at least have a way to differentiate the two versions."

Cheers,

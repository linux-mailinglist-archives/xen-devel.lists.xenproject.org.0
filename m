OK, I think that's using the method described in 8.5.5 of delivery of
Capsules via file on Mass Storage, which doesn't use the
UpdateCapsule() runtime API?

Using such method doesn't require QueryCapsuleCapabilities(), as
that's used to know whether a certain capsule can be updated via
UpdateCapsule().

Right, so you only need access to the ESRT table, that's all. Then I
think we need to make sure Xen doesn't use this memory for anything
else, which will require some changes in Xen (or at least some
checks?).

We also need to decide what to do if the table turns out to be placed
in a wrong region. How are we going to prevent dom0 from using it
then? My preference would be to completely hide it from dom0 in that
case, such that it believes there's no ESRT at all if possible.

Thanks, Roger.

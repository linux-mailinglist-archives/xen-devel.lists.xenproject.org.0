As said in a reply earlier on another sub-thread, (NOLOAD) is meaningless
for PE. The fact that I add them nevertheless is just for docs purposes
(or if, in the future, the item gains significance).

The main problem though isn't "load" vs "no-load" but, as I thought I
have expressed in the description, that there's no "don't care about it's
RVA" in PE. All sections have to have a non-zero VA above the image base.
This is the only way via which sane RVA values can result. If sections
get placed at VA 0 (which is perfectly fine for ELF), the RVA would be a
huge negative number truncated to 32 bits. (Again, prior to binutils 2.37
this will go all silently.) Plus the respective sections would come first
(rather than last) in the binary (which by itself may or may not be a
problem for the EFI loader, but I wouldn't want to chance it).

Of course (and it's not just "could" but "will"), yet the linker will
do fine (and perhaps even better) without when building ELF. Also
note that we'll be responsible for keeping the list of sections up-to-
date. The linker will recognize Dwarf sections by looking for a
.debug_ prefix. We can't use such here (or at least I'm not aware of
a suitable mechanism); .debug_* would mean munging together all the
different kinds of Dwarf sections. Hence by limiting the explicit
enumeration to PE, I'm trying to avoid anomalies in ELF down the road.

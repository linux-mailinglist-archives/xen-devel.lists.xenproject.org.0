There is nothing (not even ITSC handling, which was buggy) which Xen can
legitimately do with the information.

It is conceptually wrong, and a layering violation, for Xen to have this
information, or to be making any assumptions about it.

That is some very wild assumptions.

What if someone is trying to debug a time related issue, and wants to
turn itsc off?

Because silently trampling the configuration chosen by the toolstack
isn't acceptable.

The toolstack (legitimately) has knowledge of nomigrate, and will even
implicitly turn on ITSC as a side effect, but will also honour explicit
requests to turn it on or off.

I can fix it on commit.Â  I don't waste time tracking whether it has had
its conditional bump.

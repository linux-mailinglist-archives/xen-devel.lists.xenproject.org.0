They were introduced right at the beginning of the ARM port because we 
have quite a few platforms where the memory doesn't start at 0 and there 
was still a fairly large hole between two banks. IIRC until this series 
we would have been able to handle the hole but not the offset.

This is can be handled in common, then I would be happy with that.

This is following the other pattern within the Arm port. We want to fail 
early with a clear error rather than booting an half broken system.

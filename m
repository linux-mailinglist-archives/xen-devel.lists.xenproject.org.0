Are you suggesting to also fallback on the older hypercall?

There can be multiple mapping for the grant frame. But there can be 
*only* one mapping for the grant *table* frame.

This was forgotten because it is not yet common to use EDK2 on Xen on 
Arm (the proof is it took one year to find the obvious bug). I agree 
this is not user friendly, but it is impossible to check all the single 
projects. I will usually only look at the one that I know are used on 
Arm and/or someone remind me on the ML.

AFAIK, we have CI for x86 on EDK2 but we don't on Arm.

Bertrand/Stefano, any opinions?

Indeed. But -ENOTIME and so far no-one else shown any interest :).

Yes. The protocol is documented in 
https://docs.kernel.org/arch/arm64/booting.html.

Unfortunately, the situation is unlikely to change if no one puts any 
effort to fix it and add testing.

While I am on the reviewer list for EDK2, I don't have the bandwith to 
rewiew, let alone working on it. In fact, I have been looking for 
someone to replace me as the reviewer for EDK2 in the past few months. 
The role is still open if someone has any interest and more time to 
allocate.

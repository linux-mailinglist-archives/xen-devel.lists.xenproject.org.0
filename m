I'm with Andrew here, fwiw, as long as the little bit of code that
is actually put in common/ or include/xen/ doesn't imply arbitrary
restrictions on acceptable values. For example, unless there is
proof that for all architectures of interest currently or in the
not too distant future an order value is fine (as opposed to a
size one), then an order field would be fine to live in common
code imo. Otherwise it would need to be a size one, with per-arch
enforcement of further imposed restrictions (like needing to be a
power of 2).

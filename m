Well, okay, I'll consider the patch rejected then, despite thinking
that it could save us from subtle issues down the road.

Of course, but it won't help until we've audited and (if needed)
amended all code using is_pv_*() or e.g. implying PV when !is_hvm_*().

Patch 2, while grouped with this one, is technically independent.
Therefore I'd still appreciate separate feedback there.

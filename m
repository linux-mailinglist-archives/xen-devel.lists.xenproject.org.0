For Qemu and SiFive, 32M is definitely not worth worrying about.

I personally wouldn't worry about Microchip either.Â  That's 4G of 1T VA
space (assuming Sv39).

I firmly recommend option 1, especially at this point.

If specific boards really have a problem with losing 4G of VA space,
then option 2 can be added easily at a later point.

That said, I'd think carefully about doing option 2.Â  Even subtracting a
constant - which is far better than subtracting a variable - is still
extra overhead in fastpaths.Â  Option 2 needs careful consideration on a
board-by-board case.

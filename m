Special pages are allocated by Xen for grant-table, vCPU info...

My initial approach was to free the IOMMU page tables during early 
failure (see [1] and [2]). But Jan said the special pages should really 
not be mapped in the IOMMU ([3]) and he wasn't very happy with freeing 
the IOMMU pages table for early failure.

I don't particularly care about the approach as long as we don't leak 
IOMMU page-tables at the end.

So please try to find a common ground with Jan here.

Cheers,

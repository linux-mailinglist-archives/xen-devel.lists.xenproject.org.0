That's different: "=D" specifies the register, and "1" says "use
the same register as input". Whereas, as said, "=&r" says "use
any register" with "1" saying "use the same register" and (_a4)
specifying where the value is to come from.

That's a fair statement, but then still the description wants
re-wording. Plus of course future gcc is free to change their
behavior to that currently observed with clang.

Consider the following example (on an arch where "f" is a
floating point register and there are ways to copy directly
between GPR and floating point registers:

   int i;
   register float f asm("f7") = <input>;
   asm("..." : "=r" (i) : "0" (f));

In this case obviously f7 can't be used for i (as it doesn't
match "r"). It's merely that the initial value of i is to come
from f7. In fact for Arm64 this

extern float flt;

int test(void) {
	int i;
	register float f asm("s7") = flt;
	asm("add %0,%0,5" : "=r" (i) : "0" (f));
	return i;
}

behaves exactly as described:

test:
        adrp    x0, flt
        ldr     s7, [x0, @lo12(flt)]
        fmov    w0, s7
        add     x0, x0, #5
        ret

(Whether fmov is a sensible choice here is a different question;
I'd have expected some fcvt*.)

Similarly a constant initial value would demonstrate this (or
one necessarily coming from memory), albeit in a less obvious
way: It doesn't say "this constant lives in the register", but
"this constant is to be loaded into the register".

Our coding style document imo ought to describe things not already
specified by the standard. What scopes certain identifiers are to
be considered reserved in is, however, written down there already.

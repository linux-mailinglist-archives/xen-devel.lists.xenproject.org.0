I'm afraid I don't understand your concern and/or description of
the scenario. Prior to the change, the bit was set unconditionally.
To me, _that_ was making the bit useless - no point in checking
something which is always set anyway (leaving aside old Xen
versions). I also don't follow how presence / absence of a passed
through device mattering (or not) would have changed with this
patch.

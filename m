I'm not convinced of this - there are many MSRs which merely
need reading to discover a certain piece of (configuration)
information. Note in e.g. how the problem I did run into was
affecting RDMSR only.

This part I agree with; in fact I did mention this earlier on.

Well, for your change it's indeed "an option". For my change it's
not optional behavior (and we also don't mean it to be). Hence I'm
not sure what I should read out of your reply.

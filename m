We do override the default (on gcc) when using livepatch anyway, so we
might as well be consistent and attempt to provide a value that's
reasonable?

Linux currently uses 16-byte also on x86 and set in Kconfig, and all
compiler versions I've tested use 16-bytes with -O2, so I think it's
unlikely to change overnight (and a lot of software will still use 16
anyway).

If a more suitable value is needed in the future we can always adjust,
that's the whole point of having it in Kconfig.  We can also select a
better value even in compilers that might not know about it.

Thanks, Roger.

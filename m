Right, the ESRT must be available so that dom0 can discover the
resources.

OK, by reading the UEFI spec I assumed that you needed access to
QueryCapsuleCapabilities and UpdateCapsule in order to perform the
updates, and those should be proxied using hyopercalls. Maybe this is
not mandatory and there's a side-band mechanism of doing this?

I think we need more info here.

We already do this for ACPI in PVH dom0, where Xen rebuilds the RSDT
in order to filter out tables that shouldn't be exposed to dom0. If
possible using something similar for UEFI would be my preference, but
I certainly haven't investigated at all whether this is feasible.

For PVH dom0 we should make sure the ESRT is identity mapped into the
physmap, so that dom0 has access to it. PVH dom0 gets a physical
memory map that's basically the native one with the RAM regions
adjusted to match the assigned memory.

We already identity map a bunch of stuff there, so identity mapping
the ESRT would be likely fine.

So then the update is done when rebooting? If we expose the ESRT we
should also make sure the run-time services related to it are
available.

Thanks, Roger.

I see, I shouldn't have adjusted this first call to store pt_vector,
and just leave pt_vector as initialized (-1) to not rely on
hvm_isa_irq_assert returning -1.

Coalescing both calls would make the code harder to read IMO, as then
the condition of the if clause would need to be moved inside the call
to hvm_isa_irq_assert in order to decide whether to pass NULL or
vioapic_get_vector.

I always forget about that weird pirq stuff (and I'm refraining from
using other adjectives) that we have for HVM.

AFAICT vpt is already broken when trying to inject interrupts
generated from it over an event channel. hvm_ioapic_assert will return
whatever garbage is in the IO-APIC entry, which will likely not be
initialized because the GSI is routed over an event channel.

I really have no idea what hvm_ioapic_assert should return in that
case, the event channel callback vector maybe?

Maybe just returning -1 would be fine, a guest using this routing of
pirqs over event channels shouldn't be using any of the emulated
timers, and hence vpt is not required to be functional in that case?

Sure.

Yup, that's indeed better.

Thanks, Roger.

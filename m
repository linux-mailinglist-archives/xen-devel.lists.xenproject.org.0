Yes, but this is nothing really new as ballooning would result to 
(AFAICT) the same behavior on Linux.

We already discussed that last year :). This was attempted in the past 
(I was still at Citrix) and indefinitely paused for Arm.

/proc/iomem can be incomplete on Linux if we didn't load a driver for 
all the devices. This means that Linux doesn't have the full view of 
what is physical range is freed.

Additionally, in the case of Dom0, all the regions corresponding to the 
host RAM are unusable when using the SMMU. This is because we would do 
1:1 mapping for the foreign mapping as well.

It might be possible to take advantage of the direct mapping property if 
Linux do some bookeeping. Although, this wouldn't work for 32-bit Dom0 
using short page tables (e.g some version of Debian does) as it may not 
be able to access all the host RAM. Whether we still care about is a 
different situation :).

For all the other domains, I think we would want the toolstack to 
provide a region that can be safely used for foreign mapping (similar to 
what we already do for the grant-table).

IIUC your proposal, you are assuming that you will have enough free 
space in the physical address space to map the foreign mapping.

However that amount of free space is not unlimited and may be quite 
small (see above). It would be fairly easy to exhaust it given that a 
userspace application can map many times the same guest physical address.

So I still think we need to be able to allow Linux to swap a foreign 
page with another page.

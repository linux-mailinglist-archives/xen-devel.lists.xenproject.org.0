Oh, so we didn't use to expose x2APIC in Xen < 4.14 for PV at all?

I think this need mentioning in the commit message, as it's not clear
whether x2APIC has always been advertised to guests.

If it's indeed only Xen 4.14 that started exposing the flag, it's IMO
less dangerous to stop exposing it.  My main concern would be OSes
having grow some dependency on it, and us no longer exposing it
causing collateral damage (which would be an OS bug anyway).

IIRC if you use the 'S' tag it won't be added to the default PV policy
already, so there should be nothing to clear?  pv_def_featuremask
shouldn't contain the bit in the first place.

Thanks, Roger.

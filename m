Subject: [XEN PATCH v7 14/51] xen: move include/asm-* to arch/*/include/asm
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 2021 11:50:01 +0100

This avoid the need to create the symbolic link "include/asm".

Whenever a comment refer to an "asm" headers, this patch avoid
spelling the arch when not needed to avoid some code churn.

One unrelated change is to sort entries in MAINTAINERS for "INTEL(R)
VT FOR X86 (VT-X)"

Notes:
    v7:
    - fix MAINTAINERS entry for arch-riscv
    - move to arch/*/include/asm instead
    - In most comment refering to an asm headers, avoid spelling the arch
      name when not needed.
      That doesn't work "common/efi/runtime.c" as the description of Xen's
      stack is only in x86's "asm/current.h" and not in arm's "asm/current.h".
    - sort entries in MAINTAINERS for "INTEL(R) VT FOR X86 (VT-X)"

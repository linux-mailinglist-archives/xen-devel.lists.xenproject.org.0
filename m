I suspect this was in order to make the EFI stub completely independent 
to Xen (this is the case for Linux Arm). It turns out we now have an 
hybrid model as we re-use pass some information in the DT and other via 
variables.

EFI stub is only supported for Arm64. So it should be sufficient to 
introduce the asm/unaligned.h on Arm64.

Note that on Arm32 we forbid unaligned access. So we may need two set of 
helpers (I haven't looked at what the header does).

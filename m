I forgot to add the word "remove" in the sentence.

Do you mean clean/invalidate to PoC/PoU? Something else?

I am a bit confused. Those flush could also happen with the MMU on. So 
how turning off the MMU would result to a problem? Note that the data 
cache is still enabled during the switch.

The cache line will be flushed at some point in the future. I would 
argue if the caller need it earlier, then it should make sure to issue 
the flush before switch_ttbr().

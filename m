Subject: [PATCH] x86/spec-ctrl: Skip RSB overwriting when safe to do so
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:26:41 +0100
Message-ID: <20210819162641.22772-1-andrew.cooper3@citrix.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.11.0
MIME-Version: 1.0

In some configurations, it is safe to not overwrite the RSB on entry to Xen.
Both Intel and AMD have guidelines in this area, because of the performance
difference it makes for native kernels.

A simple microperf test, measuring the amount of time a XENVER_version
hypercall takes, shows the following improvements:

  KabyLake:     -13.9175% +/- 6.85387%
  CoffeeLake-R:  -9.1183% +/- 5.04519%
  Milan:        -17.7803% +/- 1.29808%

This is best case improvement, because no real workloads are making
XENVER_version hypercalls in a tight loop.  However, this is the hypercall
used by PV kernels to force evtchn delivery if one is pending, so it is a
common hypercall to see, especially in dom0.

The avoidance of RSB-overwriting speeds up all interrupts, exceptions and
system calls from PV or Xen context.  RSB-overwriting is still required on
VMExit from HVM guests for now.

In terms of more realistic testing, LMBench in dom0 on an AMD Rome system
shows improvements across the board, with the best improvement at 8% for
simple syscall and simple write.

Backporting note.  This depends on the order of CR4 setup in __start_xen()
being ahead of the call to init_speculation().  I'm not sure how stable the
order was going backwards.

Raw stats data is here: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/0d59b024/

I was surprised that CoffeeLake's improvement wasn't better than KabyLake.
CFL-R has meltdown fixed vs KBL, so XPTI is a hit which ought to be visible in
this benchmark.  Also, MSR_SPEC_CTRL differes between the ucode-retrofitted
version and one of the early in-hardware versions.  We have yet to make use of
eIBRS so there is definitely an improvement to be had on CFL-R.

This is a good point, but ...

... this would then trigger (or other badness result) if the

Let's first settle on what exactly to do here, because this
may then affect what exactly those comments would want to
say. (If the patch here ended up touching at least one of
the two involved pieces of code, perhaps such comments
could also get added while altering that code.)

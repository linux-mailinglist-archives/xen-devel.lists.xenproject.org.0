In this case I agree with splitting; I wasn't aware clang implemented
the respective insns piecemeal.

So you put me in a really awkward position: I'd really like to see
this series go in for 4.14, yet I've previously indicated I want the
underlying concept to first be agreed upon, before any uses get
introduced.

A fundamental problem with this, at least as long as (a) more of
Anthony's series hasn't been committed and (b) we re-build Xen upon
installing (as root), even if it was fully built (as non-root) and
is ready without any re-building. Each of these aspects means that
what you've configured and built may not be what gets installed, by
virtue of the tool chains differing. (a) in addition may lead to
the install-time rebuild to actually go wrong, due to there being
dependency tracking issues on at least {xen,efi}.lds (which I've
noticed in a different context yesterday).

Is this actually checking the right thing in the clang case? I.e.
doesn't "-x assembler" make clang invoke the system assembler rather
than use its integrated one, whereas you need the insns to be
recognized by the integrated assembler unless we find a need to pass
-no-integrated-as?

For both patches, I think it would still be useful to retain the explanation
about the MISRA Rule 2.2 violation in the commit message. While I agree that
the first paragraph provides sufficient justification on its own, the additional
context helps clarify why we're committing this change now, rather than waiting
until after the release. It also highlights the additional benefit of improving
MISRA compliance by removing this dead code.

Anyway, I am okay with having these patches merged now:

Even if Eclair can't know it, such code is violating Misra rule 2.2 (dead
code; we didn't accept that yet, but - where possible - we probably would
better follow it). Depending on one's reading, this code may actually be a
violation of rule 2.1 (unreachable), which we did accept:

"Code is unreachable if, ..., there is no combination of program inputs
 that can cause it to be executed."

Otoh it's "only" __init code.

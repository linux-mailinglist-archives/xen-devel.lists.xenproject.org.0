There's no overriding back, I don't think: I change the table entries
for opcodes 0x38 and 0x39, with no other adjustments the the attributes
later on. For the other opcodes I leave the table entries as they are,
and override the attributes for the specific sub-cases (identified by
ModRM.reg).

For opcodes 0x38 and 0x39 the change of the table entries implies
changing the order of operands as passed to emulate_2op_SrcV(), hence
the splitting of the cases in the main switch().

I didn't think this was necessary to spell out in the commit message,
but of course I can re-use most of the text above and add it into
there, if you think that would help.

Unfortunately looking at the GCC manual pages [1], it doesn't seem to be
possible. The problem is that the definition of "S" changes between
aarch64 and arm (the 32-bit version).

For aarch64:

S   An absolute symbolic address or a label reference

This is what we want. For arm instead:

S   A symbol in the text segment of the current file

This is not useful for what we need to do here. As far as I can tell,
there is no other way in GCC assembly inline for arm to do this.

So we have 2 choices: we use the __used keyword as Xenia did in this
patch. Or we move the implementation of switch_stack_and_jump in
assembly. I attempted a prototype of the latter to see how it would come
out, see below.

I don't like it very much. I prefer the version with __used that Xenia
had in this patch. But I am OK either way.

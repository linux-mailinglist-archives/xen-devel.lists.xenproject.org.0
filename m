What do you mean by "still stale"? Other insns allowing for only
memory operands have the #UD spelled out in the doc. Are you
implying by the 2nd sentence that it should rather be
"goto unrecognized_insn"? I'm afraid we're not very consistent
yet with what we do in such cases; I could certainly work
towards improving this, but the question is whether it is really
sensible in all cases to assume such partially unused encodings
may get used in the future.

Thanks, but as per my reply to your patch 6 comment the patch
here will need to be revised, so I'll not apply this just yet
unless you indicate up front that you're fine with me keeping it.

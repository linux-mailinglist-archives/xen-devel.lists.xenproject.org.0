I don't particularly want to have the FF-A mediator out of the TEE 
mediator. At the moment, it is unclear to me how much of the SMC 
handling code can really be shared between a domain talking with the 
host firmware and an emulated version. Are we just going to end up to 
have "if firmware then to this else do that"?

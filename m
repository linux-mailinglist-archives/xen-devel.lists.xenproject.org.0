Yeah..

Yes, something like that. We have a framework for reading, editing and
generating Device Tree: Lopper https://github.com/devicetree-org/lopper

It is mostly targeted at build time but it could also be invoked on
target at runtime.

I don't feel strongly whether it should be a library, a script or
something else. My only point is that it should be easy to use both at
build time (e.g. Yocto/Zephyr/ImageBuilder/Lopper) and runtime
(xl/libxl).

We have already a partial DTB generator as a Lopper "lop" (a Lopper
plugin). Probably using Lopper would be the easiest way to implement it,
and the "lop" could be under xen.git (it doesn't have to reside under
the lopper repository).

But if we wanted a library that would be OK too. The issue with libxl is
not much that it is a library but that it is complex to build and has
many dependencies (it can only be built from the top level ./configure
and make).

Ideally this would be something quick that can be easily invoked as the
first step of an external third-party build process.

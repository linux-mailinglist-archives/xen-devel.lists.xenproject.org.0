This would then require conditionals in paths using other parts of
the per-domain mappings for 64-bit PV, as the same range is under
guest control there.

First of all this is an unrelated question - I'm not changing what
gets accessed there, but only through which addresses these accesses
happen. What lives there are GDT/LDT mappings, map cache, and the
argument translation area. The guest has no control (or very limited
when considering GDT/LDT one) over the accesses made to this space.

Of course, I know. I was the one to actually add them, after all. But:
Are you (silently) adding a 4th way of booting Xen, using xen.efi yet
not its PE-header-specified entry point? So far we had three ways only:
Non-EFI (xen.gz:start), native EFI (xen.efi:efi_start), and GrUB2+EFI
(xen.gz:__efi64_mb2_start). You effectively suggest GrUB2+EFI
(xen.efi:__efi64_mb2_start), if I'm not mistaken. Where is such a mode
even specified? When using the MB2 entry point, it's not obvious at all
whether the boot loader is even supposed to be respecting the .reloc
section of the PE binary (imo that's contrary to the original idea of
multiboot).

Note how here is the first time that you actually mention you're adding
a new boot mode. That's quite relevant as context for the entire series,
I would say.

Of course, if in the course of GrUB's loading of xen.efi base relocations
are applied (unlike when loading an ELF binary, where afaik base relocs
would be ignored, even if there were any), then this calculation is of
course going to be wrong. Can't we correct it though, to properly resemble
PIC code:

        /* Calculate the load base address. */
        call    1f
1:      pop     %esi
        sub     1b - start, %esi

or (because start is in a different section):

        /* Calculate the load base address. */
        call    1f
1:      pop     %esi
        sub     $sym_offs(1b), %esi
        add     $sym_offs(start), %esi

(or something along these lines)?

How does %esi matter at .Lnot_multiboot? It starts mattering from
x86_32_switch onwards, and it is being set there.

Yet that has been working fine for xen.gz? There definitely is a risk,
but that risk isn't new afaict.

All cases there where %esi would matter branch to x86_32_switch first
afaics. As mentioned, %esi is being set one of the first things after
the x86_32_switch label.

Well, now that I learned that you're trying to add a new boot mode,
there's no need for a Fixes: tag. Yet the patch title then also
shouldn't say "Fix" - that made it look like you're addressing some
problem with one of the existing boot modes we have.

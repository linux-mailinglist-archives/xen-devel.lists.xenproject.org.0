Now I understand why you made a comment previously about Xen having to
configure trigger and polarity for these interrupts on its own.

Yes makes sense

On ARM, Xen doesn't need to wait for dom0 to configure interrupts
correctly. Xen configures them all on its own at boot based on Device
Tree information. I guess it is not possible to do the same on x86? If
not, then I can see why we would need 1 extra toolstack hypercall for
that (or to bundle the operation of configuring IO-APIC pins together
with an existing toolstack hypercall).

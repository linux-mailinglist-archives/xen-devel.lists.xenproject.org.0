And I had replied to that, indicating my (at least partial)
disagreement as well as asking for clarification on an apparently
incomplete sentence in your response.

Note that in an initial (3 months earlier) reply you did say

"On that subject, it would be very helpful to at least be able to
 configure reduced builds from these utilities."

which I responded to

"Yes, I too have been thinking this way. I may get there eventually."

I specifically meant FPU-less, MMX-less, and SIMD-less each on their
own.

I'm also not at all convinced of, as you say, "a build of Xen will
either need everything, or just the integer group". Yes, for now I
unilaterally disable all three for !HVM here, but that's just
because we know of no PV guests trying to update their page tables
in "interesting" ways. Long term I think this would better be a
separate Kconfig option (or multiple ones, if we stick to keeping
the three groups here to have separate controls), merely defaulting
to !HVM. I could of course switch to such an approach right away.

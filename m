I've thought the same when speaking with Ian about this, as (for HVM
passthrough) we use the physdev op to obtain a pirq from a physical
device interrupt source (a MSI entry in the QEMU case, because the
legacy interrupt is bound by the toolstack IIRC) and then use that
pirq to bind it to a guest lapic vector.

I think in a sense such physical interrupt abstraction (the pirq) is
helpful in order to simplify the binding, as you don't end up with a
hypercall with a massive number of parameters to identify both the
source and destination interrupt data. It's also helpful when the
guest changes the interrupt binding, as you then only update the guest
side and keep using the same pirq.

We might want however to have an interface more specific to
passthrough, such that the pirqs (or maybe we could just call them
handles) returned by such interface can only be used with guest
specific bind hypercalls?

Having xenpt in tree would be fine IMO. Now we have all the proper
infrastructure in place to allow different pci devices to be handled
by different emulators IIRC, which is all that's required for this to
work correctly.

Thanks, Roger.

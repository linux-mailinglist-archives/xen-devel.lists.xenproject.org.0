So after committing I noticed that ...

... with this conversion the int3 was lost. Therefore I've reverted
the commit, for not having any real effect.

On top of this I've also noticed only now that this doesn't cover
the issue everywhere - asm-macros.h doesn't get included by some of
the files, and hence there the wanted transformation doesn't occur.
But I'm not sure we want to force its inclusion uniformly, from
e.g. asm-x86/config.h.

OK, let me try to add another comment for __io_apic_eoi() in v4 then.

I'm not sure what's the benefit of the extra logic to detect such
cases, just to avoid a write to the io_apic_pin_eoi matrix.

The only purpose of the io_apic_pin_eoi matrix is to cache what's
currently in the RTE entry 'vector' field.  I don't think we should
attempt to add extra logic as to whether the entry is valid, or
masked.  Higher level layers should already take care of that.  The
only purpose of the logic added in this patch is to ensure the EOI is
performed using what's in the RTE vector field for the requested pin.
Anything else is out of scope IMO.

Another option, which would allow to make the matrix store uint8_t
elements would be to initialize it at allocation with the RTE vector
fields currently present, IOW: do a raw read of every RTE and set the
fetched vector field in io_apic_pin_eoi.  Would that be better to you,
as also removing the need to ever store IRQ_VECTOR_UNASSIGNED?

Yes, it should pass IRQ_VECTOR_UNASSIGNED IMO.  The extra cost of
doing the RTE read is not an issue on that init-only path.

More than improving performance the patch is about not degrading it by
forcing an RTE read for each EOI.

I expect there's no such read ATM, since the vector should be provided
by irq_desc.  Adding an unconditional RTE read for each EOI would be
an unjustified performance penalty for this fix to introduce.

See my suggestion above about getting rid of IRQ_VECTOR_UNASSIGNED in
io_apic_pin_eoi altogether.

Thanks, Roger.

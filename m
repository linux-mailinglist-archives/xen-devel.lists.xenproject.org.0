Isn't this an independent goal? Or is this a statement on what you see
my change (kind of) doing, indicating you consider this wrong?

I fear it remains unclear to me what exactly you mean here. It feels like
you may be suggesting that all other uses of PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE should be
dropped, without replacement. That seems wrong to me, though. In
particular I'm of the opinion that besides using "make pvshim_defconfig"
people ought to also have the option to properly configure a shim build
from scratch (or from any random .config they hold in hands), requiring
respective "depends on" and/or "select" / "imply" to be in place. Or else
they may end up with a lot of dead code. (Just consider e.g. HVM=n: We
also don't permit HVM-only stuff to be enabled in that case, as any of
that would again be dead code then.)

We have this file already. I consider it debatable though whether this file
should really force PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE=y. People may read "pvshim" in the
name as either "works just as shim" or "can also work as shim".

Is it? It has been my understanding that defaults get re-evaluated as user
input is processed.

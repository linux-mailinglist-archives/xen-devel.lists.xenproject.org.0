Yes, writing changelogs is hard. :)

Let's try though.  I was missing some key pieces of background here.
Believe it or not, I had no idea off the top of my head what _PDC was or
why it's important.

the information about _PDC being required on all processors was missing,
as was the information about the dom0's incomplete concept of the
available physical processors.

== Background ==

In ACPI systems, the OS can direct power management, as opposed to the
firmware.  This OS-directed Power Management is called OSPM.  Part of
telling the firmware that the OS going to direct power management is
making ACPI "_PDC" (Processor Driver Capabilities) calls.  These _PDC
calls must be made on every processor.  If these _PDC calls are not
completed on every processor it can lead to inconsistency and later
failures in things like the CPU frequency driver.

In a Xen system, the dom0 kernel is responsible for system-wide power
management.  The dom0 kernel is in charge of OSPM.  However, the Xen
hypervisor hides some processors information from the dom0 kernel.  This
is presumably done to ensure that the dom0 system has less interference
with guests that want to use the other processors.

== Problem ==

But, this leads to a problem: the dom0 kernel needs to run _PDC on all
the processors, but it can't always see them.

== Solution ==

In dom0 kernels, ignore the existing ACPI method for determining if a
processor is physically present because it might not be accurate.
Instead, ask the hypervisor for this information.

This ensures that ...

Is that about right?

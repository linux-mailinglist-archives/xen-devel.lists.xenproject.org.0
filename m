Would you be ok if the comment is only on top of the __test_and_* 
version? (So no comments on top of the generic_*)

I didn't realise this was an existing comment. I think the suggestion is 
a little bit odd because you could use the atomic version of the helper.

Looking at Linux, the second sentence was dropped. But not the first 
one. I would suggest to do the same. IOW keep:

"
If two examples of this operation race, one can appear to succeed but 
actually fail.
"

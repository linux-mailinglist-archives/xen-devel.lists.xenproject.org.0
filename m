I'm confused. Couldn't we switch from uint64_aligned_t to plain
uint64_t (like it's currently on the Linux headers), and then use the
compat layer in Xen to handle the size difference when called from
32bit environments?

This would of course assume that no toolstack has implemented direct
calls using this interface, which seems likely because it either
returns mfns to be mapped in the PV case or require gfns to be
provided for HVM.

OK, let me take a look.

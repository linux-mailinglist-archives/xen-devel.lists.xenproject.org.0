This is the goal. I do not expect the patch to be committed right
now, so I left those intentionally to provide some background
when those options were discussed before and, possibly, to
address some questions which were brought earlier.
The final patch will have all those in the way you mention here

All files are excluded from formatting, but xen/ directory: this is
by providing a top level .clang-format file which disables all
formatting and also providing xen/.clang-format which is exactly
for xen/.
What is more, there is no automation yet, so this is up to a user
to decide whether they want to run git clang-format or not.

Exactly, it will throw an error.

This is actually a question if clang-format of a given version supports
options in .clang-format or not. If it doesn't it will throw an error
anyways.

Sure, see my explanation above: this is just to give some more context
and have some ready answers for the questions being asked before.
I will remove all these right after we have some consensus.

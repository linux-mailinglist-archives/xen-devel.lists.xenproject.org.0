Subject: [PATCH v4 08/10] xen/docs: refine docs about static shared memory
Date: Mon, 11 Sep 2023 12:04:40 +0800

This commit amends docs(docs/misc/arm/device-tree/booting.txt) to include the
new scenario where host address is not provided in "xen,shared-mem" property,
and we also add a new example to explain in detail.

We also fix some buggy info in the docs, like SHMID is "my-shared-mem-1",
not "0x1".

I'm not sure this is a sensible approach.

A bar at 0 is utterly unusable, because it is outside of the host bridge
window.

The absence of any coherent GPA map for guests (needs fixing for oh so
many reasons) is a primary contributor to the problem, because Xen
*should* know where the guest's low and high MMIO windows are before
attempting to map BARs into the guest.

The proper fix is to teach Xen about GPA maps, and reject BAR insertion
outside of the respective bridge windows.

An fix in the short term would be to disable the problematic BAR when
scanning the PCI bus to being with.

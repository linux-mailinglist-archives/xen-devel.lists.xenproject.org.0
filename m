Hmm, originally I was under the impression that these could conceivably
be written by OSes, and hence would want dealing with separately. But
upon re-reading I see that they are supposed to be set by the BIOS alone.
So yes, let me add them for read access, taking care of the limitation
that I had to spell out.

This raises the question then though whether to also include SMMAddr
and SMMMask in the set - the former does get accessed by Linux as well,
and was one of the reasons for needing 6eef0a99262c ("x86/PV:
conditionally avoid raising #GP for early guest MSR reads").

Especially for SMMAddr, and maybe also for IORR_BASE, returning zero
for DomU-s might be acceptable. The respective masks, however, can
imo not sensibly be returned as zero. Hence even there I'd leave DomU
side handling (see below) for a later time.

Such a fixed scheme may be too limiting, I'm afraid.

As said in the post-commit-message remark, I don't think returning 0
here is appropriate. I'd be willing to move DomU handling here, but
only once it's sane.

It's for an unrelated set of MSRs, so I thought I'd leave it alone
here. Otoh the value is at best bogus anyway, as it assumes both
halves of fixed-size MTRRs get accessed separately. So I guess
since you ask for it, I'll drop it at this occasion.

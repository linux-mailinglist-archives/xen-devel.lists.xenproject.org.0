Let me start by saying that I don't feel strongly either way, so I am
happy to go with other people's opinion on this one.

In this kind of situations I usually look at two things:
- what the specification says
- what the existing code actually does

In general, I try to follow the specification unless obviously
production code relies on something that contradicts the spec, in which
case I'd say to update the spec.

In this case, although it is true that "modules" could be nice to have,
it is missing a compatible string, it is not described in
arm/device-tree/booting.txt, and it is only rarely used.

For these reasons, I don't think it is a problem that we need to fix.
Especially considering that the EFI case is the only case not working
and it was never supported until now.

If we want to add support for "modules", that could be fine, but I think
we should describe it in arm/device-tree/booting.txt and also add a
compatible string for it. For 4.16 I'd just update the wikipage.

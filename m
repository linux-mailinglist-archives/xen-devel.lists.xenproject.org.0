If it can't sensibly be split, so be it, I would say. And yes, the
approach does look sensible to me, supported by ...

... this diffstat. Good work!

Just a couple of nits, but before giving this my ack I may need to
go through it a 2nd time.

Nit: Like done elsewhere, omit the " != NULL"?

This looks to be possible to move into the "else" above, but on the
whole maybe everything together would best be handled by switch()?

If this triggers, would it be helpful to also log pt->source?

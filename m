for a change as controversial as this one I think it is particularly
relevant that formal aspects get obeyed to. With the acks above I
don't think the change could have gone in. I would assume you simply
forgot to add yours while committing, but then I'd have expected at
least an on-list instance of it, which I don't think I've seen. (But
yes, email hasn't been as reliable here lately as one would expect
it to be, so I'm not going to exclude that I've simply missed it.)

Me restricting my ack to just what's needed to avoid further stalling
of the change was for a reason, as you may recall. In particular I
wanted to make sure people actually supporting the approach taken
would be recognizable from the eventual commit, rather than me as
being the one who was opposed to it.

In all reality, Roger, it looks to me as if you should have dropped
my ack, as there seems to be nothing left at this point that I'm
the only maintainer of.

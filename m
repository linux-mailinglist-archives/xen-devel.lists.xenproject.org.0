I think my approach was misunderstood because there is no change in the 
existing model.

What I am suggesting is to not introduce iommu_devid_map but instead let 
libxl allocate the virtual Master-ID and create the mapping with the 
physical Master-ID.

Libxl would then update the property "iommus" in the device-tree with 
the allocated virtual Master-ID.

Each node in the partial device-tree would need to have a property
to refer to the physical device just so we know how to update the 
"iommus". The list of device passthrough will still be specified in the 
configuration file. IOW, the partial device-tree is not directly 
involved in the configuration of the guest.

So far, I don't see a particular issue with this approach because the 
vMaster ID algorithm allocation should be generic. But please let me 
know if you think there are bits I am missing.

Cheers,

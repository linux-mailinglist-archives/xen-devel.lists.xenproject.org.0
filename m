Well, yes, unfortunately review of earlier versions has resulted in
there being quite a few less read_lock() uses now than I had
(mistakenly) originally. There are a few worthwhile conversions,
but on the whole maybe I should indeed drop this change.

The purpose is, as the comment says, no new event channel allocations.
Those happen under write lock, so a read-lock-based barrier is enough
here afaict.

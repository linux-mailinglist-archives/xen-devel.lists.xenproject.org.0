They tend to be "exceptions". Node names are usually not meaningful
except for few top-level nodes without a compatible string. Cpus, memory
and chosen are all top level nodes. I don't know about "soc", that one
should probably be compatible = "simple-bus". If you have a pointer to
an "soc" node without a compatible I'd be interested in taking a look.
No worries if you don't have it handy, I was just curious.

Nice work of archaeology there!

It would be good to clarify. If we decide to go with making it clear
that "modules" is not supported then from a device tree point of view I
think we should say that "multiboot,module" nodes for Dom0 and Xen (xsm)
are children of /chosen. I prefer this option because I think that if
we wanted to group the dom0 and/or Xen modules together (which could be
good) we could come up with something better than "modules", more
aligned with dom0less.

Otherwise we could try to add a "modules" node to the description with a
compatible string and a comment saying certain legacy versions might not
have a compatible string.

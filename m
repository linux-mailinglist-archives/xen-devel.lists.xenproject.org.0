As long as the domain is not paused, ->valid_evtchns can't ever
decrease: The only point where this gets done is in evtchn_destroy().

Because of the above property plus the fact that even if
->valid_evtchns decreases, the underlying struct evtchn instance
will remain valid (i.e. won't get de-allocated, which happens only
in evtchn_destroy_final()), it is always fine to use it without
lock. With this I'm having trouble seeing what would need adding
to port_is_valid()'s commentary.

The only thing which shouldn't happen anywhere is following a
port_is_valid() check which has returned false by code assuming
the port is going to remain invalid. But I think that's obvious
when you don't hold any suitable lock.

I do intend to follow Julien's request to explain things more for
evtchn_close().

I have to admit I haven't used video output very much with PVH, I've
had reports of people having success with it, but I have no idea how
many failures there might be.

Enabling the PIT for PVH dom0 is mostly a matter of adding
XEN_X86_EMU_PIT to the emulation flags, like it's currently done for
PV dom0.

There's going to be a slight issue though, which is that the PIT will
try to inject the interrupts using the PIC IRQ0, and thus would either
need to also enable the PIC, or to instead set the timer source to
PTSRC_ioapic instead of PTSRC_isa and use GSI 0. I haven't actually
tried whether this would work, but seems better than enabling the PIC.

Roger.

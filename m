But on the other hand this is changing the memory layout quite late in the release. The risk seems limited because Xen is not loaded at the top of the virtual address space (there is the directmap afterwards).

This is a valid point. The problem is SUPPORT.md doesn't say anything 
about new HW. So in theory, if it works out-of-the-box on Xen 4.17, then 
one could expect that it should work on 4.18.

I can see why the owner of the platform may consider it critical. But I 
can see why the community may say it is not important.

This is not an easy one to solve because we don't exactly know all the 
use-cases where Xen is used. We only know the public ones.

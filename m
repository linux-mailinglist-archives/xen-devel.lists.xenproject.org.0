Right, except we're a kernel here (rather than userspace), so the
practicalities are different.

Yes...Â  Self-hosted relocatable 32bit code is tricky at the best of
times, and this is a very good example of how not to do it.

I've got a plan to get rid of it completely, but it needs a bit more of
the "switch to kbuild" series to go in first.

Typically a Reported-by: $PERSON <$EMAIL> tag, but frankly it would have
been nice if anyone had posted any of these problems to xen-devel 6
months ago when it was first discovered to be a problem.

So far, we're at one definite (and fixed) toolchain bug, one
obvious-but-not-yet-debugged toolchain bug, a robustness fix in Xen for
the 32bit mess, and overriding of a system default, and thats before
getting to the iPXE issues.

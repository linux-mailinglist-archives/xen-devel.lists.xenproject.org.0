"how to connect to Xenstore" is the subject of a different document I
have planned.

I'll likely xlink it with this doc when it's done, but it's not
something to get mixed up in here, because it's extraordinary
complicated when all cases are considered.

All xenbus commands generate a reply.¬† Here I technically mean "the
reply from XS_INTRODUCE says success", but the libxenstore library wraps
them as blocking operations.

And now I'm staring at the code, I notice that libxl fails to check the
return value and assumes success... /sigh

There are some architectures which only support starting every thread of
a core at once.¬† (That said, I'm pretty sure OpenSBI already abstracts
this behaviour for kernels on RISC-V.)

When virtualised, we have the ability to undo that misbehaviour and give
the VM a nicer executing environment.

It is a different abstraction, but it's relevant to how a VM may

That's not a question I can reasonably answer here.¬† There is an
atomic_t refcount in struct domain and that's ultimately what controls
the freeing of the structure, and oustanding mappings are one source
holding a ref, but there are others too.¬† e.g. there's one ref held for
the domain having a non-zero memory allocation.

Xen has no support for revocable grants.¬† It has been an issue under
discussion for more than a decade, but nothing has been completed.

If a rogue driver domain holds your memory hostage, tough.¬† The overall
system can recover by destroying the driver domain; one action in
DOMCTL_destroydomain is to unmap all oustanding mapped grants, which
will allow both domains to be cleaned up.

No - all of that is done in the previous section.¬† While there are
grants of the domain's mapped, it's refcount won't drop to 0.

I'm not sure why it's using the alibaster theme and not RTD theme, but I
don't have time to debug that further at this point.

This was written mostly while sat waiting for flights in Nanjing and Beijing.

If while reading this you spot a hole, congratulations.  There are holes which

+
+Lifecycle of a domid
+====================
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+A :term:`domid` is Xen's numeric identifier for a :term:`domain`.  In any
+operational Xen system, there are one or more domains running.
+
+Domids are 16-bit integers.  Regular domids start from 0, but there are some
+special identifiers, e.g. ``DOMID_SELF``, and :term:`system domains&lt;system
+domain&gt;`, e.g. ``DOMID_IDLE`` starting from 0x7ff0.  Therefore, a Xen system
+can run a maximum of 32k domains concurrently.
+
+.. note::
+
+   Despite being exposed in the domid ABI, the system domains are internal to
+   Xen and do not have lifecycles like regular domains.  Therefore, they are
+   not discussed further in this document.
+
+At system boot, Xen will construct one or more domains.  Kernels and
+configuration for these domains must be provided by the bootloader, or at
+Xen's compile time for more highly integrated solutions.
+
+Correct functioning of the domain lifecycle involves ``xenstored``, and some
+privileged entity which has bound the ``VIRQ_DOM_EXC`` global event channel.
+
+.. note::
+
+   While not a strict requirement for these to be the same entity, it is
+   ``xenstored`` which typically has ``VIRQ_DOM_EXC`` bound.  This document is
+   written assuming the common case.
+
+Creation
+--------
+
+Within Xen, the ``domain_create()`` function is used to allocate and perform
+bare minimum construction of a domain.  The :term:`control domain` accesses
+this functionality via the ``DOMCTL_createdomain`` hypercall.
+
+The final action that ``domain_create()`` performs before returning
+successfully is to enter the new domain into the domlist.  This makes the
+domain "visible" within Xen, allowing the new domid to be successfully
+referenced by other hypercalls.
+
+At this point, the domain exists as far as Xen is concerned, but not usefully
+as a VM yet.  The toolstack performs further construction activities;
+allocating vCPUs, RAM, copying in the initial executable code, etc.  Domains
+are automatically created with one "pause" reference count held, meaning that
+it is not eligible for scheduling.
+
+When the toolstack has finished VM construction, it send an ``XS_INTRODUCE``
+command to ``xenstored``.  This instructs ``xenstored`` to connect to the
+guest's xenstore ring, and fire the ``@introduceDomain`` watch.  The firing of
+this watch is the signal to all other components which care that a new VM has
+appeared and is about to start running.

xenstore lives in dom0 things are _simpler_ because it lives in the same VM

own stubdomain. A description of the grant dance (if any), would be helpful.

In that same line, having mermaid sequence diagrams would make these

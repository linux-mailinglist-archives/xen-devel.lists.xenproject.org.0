OK

OK. Probably we can't do much better than this.


One more question on the code movement, and I would also like Julien and
Bertrand to express their opinions on this.

Given that code movement is painful from a git history perspective, and
given that we have to move dom0less code to xen/common anyway to make
it available to RISC-V and also x86, could we do it in one shot here?

I am not asking to refactor the code to make it buildable on RISC-V or
X86. I am only asking to move the code to xen/common/dom0less (or
xen/common/hyperlaunch or xen/common/domain-builder as Danien and
Christopher called it) the same way you are doing it as part of this
series. It shouldn't require additional work on your side I hope.

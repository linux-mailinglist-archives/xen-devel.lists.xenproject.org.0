When implementing Xen backend, I didn't have an already working example 
so only guessed. I looked how kvmtool behaved when actually triggering 
the interrupt on Arm [1].

Taking into the account that Xen PoC on Arm advertises [2] the same irq 
type (TYPE_EDGE_RISING) as kvmtool [3] I decided to follow the model of 
triggering an interrupt. Could you please explain, is this wrong?

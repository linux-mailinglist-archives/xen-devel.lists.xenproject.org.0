Hm, as you wish. I would prefer to leave something similar to the
first part of the comment, what about:

/*
 * All PV domains (and PVH dom0) are allowed to write/read to the
 * latched value of the first RTC port, as there's no access to the
 * physical IO ports.
 */

I can adjust and then add a newline after the break in the RTC_PORT(0)
case which I missed.

Thanks, Roger.

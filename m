I particularly disagree with the "since it is access control and falls under
the purview of XSM" in there, without addressing my point regarding Xen-
internal resources. It is a fundamental hypervisor decision whether to leave
access to Xen-internal resources to XSM control. If that decision ended up
being "yes", then I agree XSM maintainers may ack a respective change. If
that decision as "no", though, acking would purely fall to REST for code
like what is being touched here.

Just to further clarify: If it was "yes" above, other Xen-internal resources
then also ought to be domain accessible based on XSM policy. I don't think
that's the case e.g. for Xen-private memory.

IOW I can't help the impression that both the patch and the ack were
provided looking at just the one special case, driven by the (perceived)
tool breakage (see below).

> https://marc.info/?l=xen-devel&m=171215073502479

In there he said in particular: "And it is incorrect because as again you
have not articulated why the lsevtchn behavior is wrong and thus whether
this is the valid corrective action." Daniel, did you even look at the code
when saying so? With the revert in place, lsevtchn is still going to fall
on the nose when XSM denies access to a particular channel. I didn't think
this needed calling out explicitly; the tool needs fixing.

I don't think it would be, but I also don't know what exact check was
thought about. I think I was quite clear about evtchn_send()'s similar
code (there may be more). All of these want to behave the same: All
involving XSM, or all not doing so. This is the kind of thing where I
don't think any "majority" can trump technical aspects. If the verdict was
"XSM", then yes, my original patch would have moved us in the wrong
direction. But then a plain revert is insufficient, and the blaming in
there also should have been done at least differently, if at all.

The error is already a dprintk(XENLOG_G_DEBUG,...). So you can't really 
do better in term of verbosity.

But I would still like to keep it as there was some weirdness hapenning 
also in the non-KPTI case (see [1]).

This is not correct, there are other hypercalls using guest physical 
address (for instance, EVTCHNOP_init_control).

At least on Arm, this is the only hypercall that requires to keep the 
virtual address across the hypercall.

For all the other hypercalls, the virtual address is used for buffer. 
This is still risky but less than this one. It is also going to be a 
major rework that would require quite a bit of work.

So I would rather trying to fix the most concerning instance now and 
address the rest afterwards.

Cheers,

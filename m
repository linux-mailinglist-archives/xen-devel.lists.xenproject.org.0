I have looked at your branch mpu_v5. In theory the P2M can be modified 
at any point of the life-cycle of the domain. This means that another 
pCPU may have the regions loaded.

If that's the case then you would likely want to ensure the entries are 
synchronized. The easiest way would be to pause/unpause the domain when 
taking/releasing the lock. There might be other way, but this indicates 
that helper would be needed for the MPU.

That said, it is not clear to me if there is any use-case where you 
would want to update the P2M at runtime. If you have known, then you 
might be able to simply return an error if the P2M is modified after the 
domain was created.

Cheers,

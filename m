Subject: [PATCH for-4.20 v3 1/5] x86/shutdown: offline APs with interrupts disabled on all CPUs
Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 12:02:05 +0100
Message-ID: <20250211110209.86974-2-roger.pau@citrix.com>

The current shutdown logic in smp_send_stop() will disable the APs while
having interrupts enabled on the BSP or possibly other APs. On AMD systems
this can lead to local APIC errors:

APIC error on CPU0: 00(08), Receive accept error

Such error message can be printed in a loop, thus blocking the system from
rebooting.  I assume this loop is created by the error being triggered by
the console interrupt, which is further stirred by the ESR handler
printing to the console.

Intel SDM states:

"Receive Accept Error.

Set when the local APIC detects that the message it received was not
accepted by any APIC on the APIC bus, including itself. Used only on P6
family and Pentium processors."

So the error shouldn't trigger on any Intel CPU supported by Xen.

However AMD doesn't make such claims, and indeed the error is broadcast to
all local APICs when an interrupt targets a CPU that's already offline.

To prevent the error from stalling the shutdown process perform the
disabling of APs and the BSP local APIC with interrupts disabled on all
CPUs in the system, so that by the time interrupts are unmasked on the BSP
the local APIC is already disabled.  This can still lead to a spurious:

APIC error on CPU0: 00(00)

As a result of an LVT Error getting injected while interrupts are masked on
the CPU, and the vector only handled after the local APIC is already
disabled.  ESR reports 0 because as part of disable_local_APIC() the ESR
register is cleared.

Note the NMI crash path doesn't have such issue, because disabling of APs
and the caller local APIC is already done in the same contiguous region
with interrupts disabled.  There's a possible window on the NMI crash path
(nmi_shootdown_cpus()) where some APs might be disabled (and thus
interrupts targeting them raising "Receive accept error") before others APs
have interrupts disabled.  However the shutdown NMI will be handled,
regardless of whether the AP is processing a local APIC error, and hence
such interrupts will not cause the shutdown process to get stuck.

Remove the call to fixup_irqs() in smp_send_stop(): it doesn't achieve the
intended goal of moving all interrupts to the BSP anyway.  The logic in
fixup_irqs() will move interrupts whose affinity doesn't overlap with the
passed mask, but the movement of interrupts is done to any CPU set in
cpu_online_map.  As in the shutdown path fixup_irqs() is called before APs
are cleared from cpu_online_map this leads to interrupts being shuffled
around, but not assigned to the BSP exclusively.

The Fixes tag is more of a guess than a certainty; it's possible the
previous sleep window in fixup_irqs() allowed any in-flight interrupt to be
delivered before APs went offline.  However fixup_irqs() was still
incorrectly used, as it didn't (and still doesn't) move all interrupts to
target the provided cpu mask.

Changes since v2:
 - s/boradcasted/broadcast/
 - Expand commit message regarding fixup_irqs().

Changes since v1:
 - Change the approach and instead rely on having interrupts uniformly
   disabled when offlining APs.

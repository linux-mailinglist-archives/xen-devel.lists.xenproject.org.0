In cases where one case is assumed to be more likely than the other
putting the more likely one first can be viewed as a mild hint to
the compiler, and hence an extra ! may be warranted in an if() or
a conditional expression. Here, however, I don't think we can
really consider one case more likely than the other, and hence I'd
suggest to avoid the !, flipping the other two expressions
accordingly. I may take the liberty to adjust this while committing
(if I'm to be the one).

No, it doesn't even do that. It uses its own .efi binary to invoke
UpdateCapsule() after a reboot, by setting up the BootNext variable to
override the boot target for the next boot only.

That is a bit of a downside here. But the reason this approach was
chosen is because that is how Windows applies capsule updates as well,
and given that many x86 vendors only care about the Windows Logo
sticker, and not about UEFI compliance, calling UpdateCapsule() from
the OS is poorly tested, and therefore broken on many platforms.

Indeed. As long as the fwupdate tooling can access the ESRT, install
its .efi binary in /boot/efi and can manipulate the BootNext EFI
variable to to invoke it, it should work fine under Xen as well.

The ESRT must be placed in memory that the OS may take ownership of,
and that is why we have this check. I think it is perfectly fine to
put the ESRT in memory that the OS will never touch in the first
place, which is much more straight-forward.

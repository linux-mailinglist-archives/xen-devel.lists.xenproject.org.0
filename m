I think so, elf_memcpy() in elf_load_image() is failing to load on the
given destination address.  Error messages should be more helpful
there.

Hm, no, not really.

We could do like multiboot2: the kernel provides us with some
placement data (min/max addresses, alignment), and Xen let's the
kernel deal with relocations itself.

Additionally we could support the kernel providing a section with the
relocations and apply them from Xen, but that's likely hm, complicated
at best, as I don't even know which kinds of relocations we would have
to support.

I'm not sure how Linux deals with this in the bare metal case, are
relocations done after decompressing and before jumping into the entry
point?

I would also need to check FreeBSD at least to have an idea of how
it's done there.

Thanks, Roger.

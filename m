Actually, thinking more about it, I think it is likely that the guest
device tree bindings will include information about how it is supposed
to be used. For instance, the domU device tree might pair an event
channel with a shared memory region so that the domU knows that they are
expected to be used together.

If Xen is to generate such a device tree for guests, then we need that
information also on the host device tree too (the one given to Xen and
discussed here.)

So, I think it would be a good idea to discuss the domU device tree
bindings for this, as part of this design document, even if we don't
implement it straight away.

Any of these options are OK, really. Aside from the other subprojects, I
think one interesting case to consider is when a user calls
get_maintainer.pl on tools/qemu-xen-dir, which should return a warning
or error because that's QEMU, not Xen.

So, I think it would be best to go with 2.2) introducing a new tag to
distinguish the Xen MAINTAINERS file from the QEMU MAINTAINERS file, so
that we can properly return a warning for tools/qemu-xen-dir, but at the
same time it could work fine for mini-os.git.

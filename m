As I stated below, it will start setting the precedent for using GPAs. 
The concern is two-fold, how much benefit can actually be achieved for 
an API/ABI that cannot be used in the final solution. And by focusing 
effort on an unusable API/ABI, how much will that reduce effort/focus on 
crafting an API/ABI that can be used.

A question I would have is why not just RFC a GPA buffer helper 
framework for the hypervisor since it will get used by the new ABI and 
not spend effort retrofitting the current ABI. Some follow-on questions 
I would also ask is, moving forward would it be expected that new 
revisions of guests using the existing ABI would be expected to move to 
GPAs and how long do people see the existing ABI to continue in new 
guest revisions after the new ABI is adopted.

Understood, and you are not the first. A very quick, and very loose, 
comparison is that currently hypercalls are managed as ioctl remote call 
with per version defined payload. This proposal would move to a packet 
dispatch where the packet is a free-form TLV that allows unknown 
elements/parameters to be present. This enables a newer toolstack , 
without requiring a constantly moving compatibility layer, to send a 
packet to an older hypervisor which can reject unknown elements and 
hypercalls to silently ignore unknown parameters. Similarly, an older 
toolstack will be able to send packets to a new hypervisor. And as I 
stated above, this approach naturally enables continuations/async 
operations and multi-call invocations. It is a significant departure, 
and thus would require substantial design and implementation work, but 
there is an opportunity here to do this work.

V/r,
DPS

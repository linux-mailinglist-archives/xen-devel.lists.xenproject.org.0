I tested a lot of kernels today. To create a good baseline I compiled
without any of our patches here
and with my config flags set.

CONFIG_AMD_PMC=y
# CONFIG_HSA_AMD is not set
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_CCP is not set

The kernel stopped as before, and hung.

Test number 2 was to boot with amdgpu.msi=0.
This still resulted in a bad boot since all the xhcd drivers complained.
We can be sure that it's not amdgpu per se.

Test number 3 was with Jason's patch. It worked, but suspend/resume is
not working well.
Generally it's not behaving like other kernels do, which makes it
actually change the behavior.
Now with test 4 I tried that thought, maybe this is still a good change?
I'm deprived of a good baseline in all this, so it's very hard to
navigate between all the variables.

Test number 4 was with Jason's patch plus the amdgpu-patch below.
It worked, even suspend/resume, 2 times, but then it all crashed and
burn with quite interesting stacktraces. Are amdgpu doing it wrong here
or is it just me nitpicking?

 /**

During the tests I fiddled with dpm settings, and it does have an effect
one the graphical output during suspend/resume. So maybe there's
hardware problems at play here as well.

I also looked through the code before and after Thomas' changes, and I
can't see that
this patch should make any functional difference compared to before the
MSI series of patches.
It's even such that is_virtual should be checked withing vector_ctrl. I
find Jason's patch
quite nice since it really places the checks on few places making it
easier not to slip.
Compared to my attempt that even failed because I forgot one more place
to put the checks.

With that said I would really like some more tests on this with
different chipsets, on Xen.
Any takers?

What I'm seeing is that there's no readl() in pci_msix_unmask(), it was
one in the code path before.
I'm very much unsure if there should be one there though.

We can really do a better job at the documentation for
pci_msi_ignore_mask, at least in msi.c,
maybe that should be a different patch adding some comments such that
driver folks really see
the benefits of using the built in restore functions e.g.

This became so much bigger project than I thought, thanks all for
chiming in on it.

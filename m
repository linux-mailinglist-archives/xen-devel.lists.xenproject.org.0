The goal is to disturb the call sites as little as possible. There's
no point avoiding the scratch registers when no call is made (i.e.
when the POPCNT insn can be used). Taking away from the compiler 7
out of 15 registers (that it can hold live data in) seems quite a
lot to me.

I don't think I do - there's a conversion to the promoted type
when adding in an unsigned int value (which is there to retain
uint64_t for the 64-bit case, while using unsigned int for all
smaller sizes, as per the parameter types of generic_hweight*()).

That's an option, yes, but I again wanted to limit the impact to
generated code (including code size) as much as possible.
generic_hweight{8,16}() take unsigned int arguments, not
uint{8,16}_t ones. Hence at the call site (when a function call
is needed) no zero extension is necessary. Therefore the MOVZ
above is to (mainly) overlay the MOV during patching, while the
POPCNT is to (mainly) overlay the CALL.

If the simpler asm()-s were considered more important than the
quality of the generated code, I think we could simply have

#define hweight16(x) hweight32((uint16_t)(x))
#define hweight8(x)  hweight32(( uint8_t)(x))

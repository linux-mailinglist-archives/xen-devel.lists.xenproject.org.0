I already prepared a patch introducing XEN_SYSCTL_PHYSCAP_vpci. We agreed
that the cap_vpci should not be set neither for x86 nor ARM. This means that
the flag vpci_is_available, which tells us about vPCI platform support (and is used
in condition to set cap_vpci) is set to false by default. Later on it should be set by vPCI driver.
For me it does not make sense for XEN_SYSCTL_PHYSCAP_vpci saying that platform does not support vPCI
but setting XEN_DOMCTL_CDF_vpci for dom0 pvh.
I would prefer not setting XEN_DOMCTL_CDF_vpci for now at all. This way we have a chance
to merge Rahul's series until friday.

Cheers,
Michal

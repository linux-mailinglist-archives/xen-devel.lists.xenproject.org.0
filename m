This patch seems to depends on the other patch series for
"test-artifacts" repo.

I've tried to compare the rootfs fs generated by this repo, and the one
generated in the "test-artifacts" repo, and I think there's a few
changes, at least for the arm64 rootfs as the changes have probably
already sailed for x86_64, namely:

    Those don't exist in the new rootfs:
        rc-update add networking sysinit
        rc-update add modloop sysinit
        rc-update add modules boot
        rc-update add sysctl boot
    There's `echo > /etc/modules` been added.

But I guess none of those matter, as it already works on x86_64 tests.

Overall, looks good, more common code between tests!

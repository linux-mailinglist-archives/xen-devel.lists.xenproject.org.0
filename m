You also can't answer why it can't happen. So between the choice of 
trying to be future-proof or handling in an emergency, I would chose the 
former.Â If you want to handle differently in the AMD port, so be it.

Hu, seriously? You are basing your decision on observation on a few 
platforms and then you tell me I theorized?

The main source of truth is the specification. This is ...

the only way we can confirm something doesn't happen is based on the 
specification. If it is not written anywhere then it can happen.

I will Nack any patch/approach that is not attempting to look at the 
specification (if any) unless obviously this will break the guest OSes. 
At which point I will weight the pros and cons.

I don't believe this is the case here. So there is no excuses to try to 
take short cut...

... this, as you've already clarified, indeed having happened.
I understand this change is independent of the earlier ones in
this series. The minor adjustment could be taken care of while
committing, and I'm inclined to not wait ...

... for Kevin's ack on this obvious part of the change,
considering his prior input on the discussion we've had (where
he did signal agreement with the removal).

However, despite this series having been posted before the
deadline, it feels to me like a change that doesn't come
without risk (and hence would have been better to have earlier
in the release cycle). Hence, Ian, I'd like to gather your
release manager opinion on taking this now vs postponing for
4.16 (and then still being a likely backporting candidate). My
vote is "pro", in case it matters.

Jan

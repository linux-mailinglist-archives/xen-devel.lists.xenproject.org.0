I did, and I committed the whole lot because of not wanting to block
the many improvements over this one aspect I disagree with. Recall
me asking what happens if the compiler (or any part of the tool chain)
gets upgraded (or, possibly worse, downgraded) between two
(incremental) builds?

The change to Kbuild was discussed. The use (and, depending on how one
views it, abuse) of Kconfig to determine tool chain capabilities wasn't,
iirc. At least not in a way that it would have been noticeable to me.

If I'm not mistaken I did make my ack on the first use of the new
behavior (in your CET series) dependent upon a subsequent discussion
(that should have occurred up front), again in an attempt to get
certain things taken care of for 4.14. This was, again iirc, in turn
referring to the earlier ack on Anthony's series, which was given in
a similarly conditional manner. (But I may be mis-remembering.)
Therefore ...

... I'm pretty puzzled: Am I now being told that I shouldn't have
made the compromises, and rather should have blocked things earlier
on? I.e. is my attempt to show reasonable behavior now being turned
back into an argument against me? If so, I can certainly draw the
obvious conclusions from that, for the future.

If I hadn't voiced my reservations long before, this _may_ indeed be
a valid position to take. But given all that had been said already
before any of this went in, I don't think it is. Anyway - despite me
not thinking it should be me (and hence it not having happened so
far), I intend (as said) to start a discussion. To be honest, I'll
be curious to see how it'll go, both in terms of number of
responses received and in terms of everyone honoring the fact that
it should _not_ matter that the logic in question was already
committed.

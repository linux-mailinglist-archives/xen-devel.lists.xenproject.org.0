I would add that when possible, the existing callers haven't been
switched to use the newly introduced per-domain pci_lock, and will
continue to use the global pcidevs lock.  This is done to reduce the
risk of the new locking scheme introducing regressions.  Those users
will be adjusted in due time.

IIRC Jan had concerns about why some existing use-cases are not
switched straight to use the new per-domain pci_lock in this patch.

Any reason to not use the newly introduced helper here?  I know the
pcidevs will never be locked here given the new lock usage, but still
it would be less confusing if the new helper was used consistently.

Otherwise we need a comment here as to why the helper can't be used,
in order to avoid confusion in the future.

I think you can just state that this check ensures there will be no
changes to the entries in d->pdev_list, but not the contents of each
entry.  No changes to d->pdev_list already ensures not devices can be
deassigned or removed from the system, and obviously makes the list
safe to iterate against.

I would also drop the explicitly mention this is intended for ASSERT
usage: there's nothing specific in the code that prevents it from
being used in other places (albeit I think that's unlikely).

I would be tempted to drop at least the '_read_' part from the name,
the name is getting a bit too long for my taste.

> +        struct domain *d_ = (d);                                 \

Why do you need this local domain variable?  Can't you use the d
parameter directly?

Such assign will prevent using a const 'd' parameter, and 'd_' itself
should be const IMO (iff we really need this).

Also sched.h is not the best place, can't you just place it in
pci.h?

Thanks, Roger.

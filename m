Ack. Could the Kconfg be adjusted to not depend on ARM_64? Just
stating it's only been tested on Arm64 would be enough IMO.

I only had an Ack from Jan, so I was missing Intel and AMD Acks, which
would now only be Intel since AMD has been absorbed by the x86
maintainers.

Oh, OK, so this is done to explicitly denote the endianness of a value
on the type itself.

Ack. In any case I think for ACPI PCI init will get called by
acpi_mmcfg_init as part of acpi_boot_init, so I'm not sure there's
much point in having something about ACPI added here, as it seems this
will be DT only?

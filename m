Right, I always get confused by the switch happening in the vmentry
path.

That only happens when the vcpu is in nested mode
(nestedhvm_vcpu_in_guestmode == true). That would be the case before a
vmexit, at least for the first call to vmx_intr_assist if there are
pending softirqs.

Note that if there are pending softirqs the second time
nvmx_intr_intercept will return 0.

Yes, that's correct.

Yes, the patch that actually fixes the issue in the box I've been
testing with is 3/3.

Xen will always use the Ack on exit feature, I currently have no way
to test whether not using Ack on exit works at all.

Right, so if I understand this correctly:

 - SVI: must be updated when Ack on exit is used, to signal the
   current in service interrupt which has been injected using a
   mechanism different than virtual interrupts.

 - RVI: should always be updated if there are pending interrupts to
   be delivered. Note that the interrupt signaled in the INTR_INFO
   field if Ack on exit is enabled is not considered pending anymore.

So I think RVI should always be updated, regardless of whether Ack on
exit is used or not. Do you agree?

Thanks, Roger.

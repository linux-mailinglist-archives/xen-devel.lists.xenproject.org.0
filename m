They may need in principle, but right now there's no instance of
such as per my comparing of the generated binaries.

If there are native types that get re-used (rather than re-created
as compat version in the compat headers, which would then necessarily
derive from {u,}int64_t directly or indirectly, as there's no other
non-derived 8-byte type that's legitimate to use in public headers -
e.g. "unsigned long long" is not legitimate to be used, and all
"unsigned long" instances [if there are any left] get converted to
"unsigned int"), yes.

Depends on what "comparing" here means. Yes, something could
presumably be invented. But it may also be that we'd be better of
doing away with the re-use of native structs. But of course doing
so will have significant fallout, which right now I have no good
idea how to deal with.

Yes, having this properly checked would definitely be nice. It's
just the "how" that's unclear to me here.

Ouch - these weren't supposed to be left in. They were just for my
debugging. Thanks for noticing.

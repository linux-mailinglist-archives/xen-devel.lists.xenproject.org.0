Just to clarify: Long before this reply of yours I understood and admitted
my mistake. A more clear / well placed comment (see further up) might have
avoided that. Still - thanks for extending the comment in what you have
committed.

What's toxic about making a mistake? What's toxic about disliking "x > 0"
for unsigned quantities? As you say, it's a matter of taste to a fair
degree. Yet there are ample cases where taste as in "make it as clear as
possible to every reader" is used to ask me or others to change style. I
don't see why I shouldn't be permitted to at least make a similar remark,
even if then it's turned down (for good or bad reasons).

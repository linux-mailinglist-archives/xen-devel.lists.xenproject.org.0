Sounds okay to me, yet I'd prefer a comment in __io_apic_eoi(), where it
may want wording a little differently.

It's not specifically the vector == 0 case alone. Shouldn't we leave
the latched vector alone when writing an RTE with the mask bit set?
Any still pending EOI (there should be none aiui) can't possibly
target the meaningless vector / index in such an RTE. Perhaps it was
wrong to suggest to overwrite (with IRQ_VECTOR_UNASSIGNED) what we
have on record.

Yet at the same time there ought to be a case where the recorded
indeed moves back to IRQ_VECTOR_UNASSIGNED.

Is there actually a reason not to pass IRQ_VECTOR_UNASSIGNED there,
to have __io_apic_eoi() determine the vector? (But of course we can
also latch entry.vector from the earlier raw read.)

Yet then the patch is to a fair part about improving performance, when the
functionality issue could be addressed with a far less intrusive change.
Which may in particular make a difference with backporting in mind. Plus
that may want at least mentioning in the description.

Well, I was thinking of transforming the if() into ASSERT().

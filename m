I am not sure to understand your argument about the space... You should 
be able to find out the size of each BARs, so you can size the MMIO 
window correctly. This shouldn't add a lot of complexity.

I am not asking any implementation for this, but we need to make sure 
the design can easily be extended for other use cases. In the case of 
server, we will likely want to expose a single vPCI to the guest.

Hmmm... Maybe I wasn't clear enough but the problem is not only 
happening with MSIs doorbells. It is also with the P2P transactions.

Again, I am not asking to implement it at the beginning. However, it 
would be good to outline the potential limitations of the approach in 
your design.

There is another option: extend the acquire hypercall to allow xenstored 
domain to map the xenstore interface. This would require more work, but 
at least it would avoid the interesting dependency on the grant table.

I think the current approach is probably OK as a developper option. 
However, we should at least document in the option that disabling the 
grant-table will also disable Xenstore (anything else?) support when 
using C Xenstored.

It might also be worth to clearly state in the doc that this is only 
intended for developer use and not supported.

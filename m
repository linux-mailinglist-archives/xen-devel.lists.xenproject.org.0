There's nothing wrong afaics, just missing at least one aspect: Did you
see all the featureset <-> policy conversions in cpu-policy.c? That (to
me at least) clearly is a sign of unnecessary duplication of the same
data. This goes as far as seeding the host policy from the raw one, just
to then immediately run x86_cpu_featureset_to_policy(), thus overwriting
a fair part of what was first taken from the raw policy. That's necessary
right now, because setup_{force,clear}_cpu_cap() act on
boot_cpu_data.x86_capability[], not the host policy.

As to the "needless" further up, it's only as far as moving those bits
into x86_capability[] would further duplicate information, rather than
(for that piece at least) putting them into the policies right away. But
yes, if the goal is to have setup_{force,clear}_cpu_cap() be able to
control those bits as well, then going the intermediate step would be
unavoidable at this point in time.

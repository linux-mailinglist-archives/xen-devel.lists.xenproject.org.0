In docs/misc/hypfs-paths.pandoc the supported paths in the hypervisor
file system are specified. Make it more clear that path availability
might change, e.g. due to scope widening or narrowing (e.g. being
limited to a specific architecture).

 The hypervisor file system is similar to the Linux kernel's sysfs.

+# Stability
+
+Path *presence* is not stable, but path *meaning* is always stable: if a tool
+you write finds a path present, it can rely on behavior in future versions of
+the hypervisors, and in different configurations.  Specifically:
+
+1. Conditions under which paths are used may be extended, restricted, or
+   removed.  For example, a path thatâ€™s always available only on ARM systems
+   may become available on x86; or a path available on both systems may be
+   restricted to only appearing on ARM systems.  Paths may also disappear
+   entirely.
+2. However, the meaning of a path will never change.  If a path is present,
+   it will always have exactly the meaning that it always had.  In order to
+   maintain this, removed paths should be retained with the tag [REMOVED].
+   The path may be restored *only* if the restored version of the path is
+   compatible with the previous functionality.
+
 ## Example
 
 A populated Xen hypervisor file system might look like the following example:

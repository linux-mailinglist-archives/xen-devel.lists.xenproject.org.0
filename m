While this survey may have been released with the best of intentions, I 
can't help but to find it poorly conceived. Banning words, whether in 
general or for a specific instance, is not something to be taken lightly 
via "informal vote", and in my humble opinion is not addressing the 
underlying issue at hand. In fact, and not to be overly dire, the result 
is that it has put the project at the verge of a fork and/or collapse of 
the project as a whole. This survey must be immediately recalled, all 
results destroyed and anyone that has reviewed said results, should not 
discuss them, either publicly or privately.

I do not feel that a rush to form a Technical Advisory Board would 
address the larger issue at hand either. I would instead call for a 
bounded-duration working group to be convened, with an explicit charter 
to collect and vet community issues. Individuals may express any and all 
grievances publicly or privately to the working group. The goal for this 
group would be to listen, debate, and ultimately draft a set of 
recommendations for governance and/or other measures to achieve 
community reconciliation.  As such, the makeup of said working group 
must be those with a cultural understanding of Xen, but a level removed 
from the day-to-day happenings on xen-devel.

For instance, I would nominate Rich Persaud to chair and oversee 
membership of the working group. To my knowledge, Rich is the longest 
standing (XenSource, 2005) active community member that has continually 
worked for the betterment of the community as a whole. He is not a 
maintainer nor a direct code contributor, which I believe best positions 
him to be objective when considering disputes. From there, not to thrust 
this upon anyone unbeknownst, but I would suggest Xen contributors like 
Christopher Clark, David Woodhouse, and Tamas Lengyl as working group 
candidates for Rich to consider.  Each could apply their experience from 
Xen and other OSS communities, and none are immersed in the day-to-day 
minutiae of Xen development.

Very Respectfully,
Daniel P. Smith

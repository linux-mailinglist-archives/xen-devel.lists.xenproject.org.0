The Ubuntu community spends effort keeping Ubuntu 16.04 in working shape, so it makes sense for us to spend effort making sure Xen 4.15 builds and runs on it.  The Alpine Linux community doesnâ€™t promise to spend any effort to fix any more bugs in Alpine Linux 3.11, so it doesnâ€™t make any sense for us to spend effort making sure Xen 4.15 runs on it.

No strict requirement - but since it's on the spec we might as well
try to honor it.

I guess it's a question of taste.  I do find it odd (asymmetric
maybe?) that we stop reporting non-existing devices once a valid
device is found.  Makes me wonder what's the point of reporting them
in the first place, if the list of non-existing devices is not
complete?

I could live with those looking differently, or register_one_rmrr()
can be adjusted later.  Existing examples shouldn't be an argument to
not make new additions better.

But that's only if you agree the suggested changes make the code
better, if you prefer the current implementation then there's no point
in arguing whether we should keep register_one_rmrr() and the newly
introduce function similar enough.

I would prefer the define unless you have strong objections, even if
that means diverging from Linux.

Given that the caller here is the one that did the allocation my
preference would be to also do the cleanup there - register_one_satc()
has no need to know what needs freeing, and allows unifying the
cleanup in a single place.

I could live with those going out-of-sync (or adjusted later), but only
if you think the suggestions are an improvement.

 Yeah, overall I think it's an improvement if we go switching those as
 we modify the code for other reasons.

 Thanks, Roger.

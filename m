How do you mean to notice the difference in Xen? You don't know
what the caller's environment's sizeof() would yield.

Plus, like uint64_aligned_t, iirc it's a construct exposed through
tool-stack-only interfaces, but not generally.

Well - if this isn't a tool stack interface (see also my 2nd reply
to your original patch), then the comment shouldn't suggest it is.

It would be good to have gitlab-ci running on the branch. However...

... AFAICT the tree can be edited by non-committers as well. I don't 
expect anyone in the list to mess up with the branch, but part of me 
would prefer if only you and I can modify it.

That said, I can push manually to xen-integration to trigger the CI 
everytime we need to update it.

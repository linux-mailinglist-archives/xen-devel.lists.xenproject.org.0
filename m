So would you be OK with the following:

Use a union with an unsigned long in order to prevent clang from
skipping a possible truncation of the value.  By using the union any
truncation is carried before the call instruction, in turn covering
for ABI-non-compliance in that the necessary clipping / extension of
the value is supposed to be carried out in the callee.

Note this behavior is not mandated by the standard, and hence could
stop being a viable workaround, or worse, could cause a different set
of code-generation issues in future clang versions.

This has been reported upstream at:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/12579

Thanks, Roger.

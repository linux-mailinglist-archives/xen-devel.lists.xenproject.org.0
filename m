I would be fine with the adjusted BUILD_BUG_ON(), but if we change the
instance for clang we should also update the BUILD_BUG_ON() used on
the gcc counterpart so they both match.  That might be undesirable
however since gcc doesn't exhibit any of those bugs, and hence
shouldn't have such constraints.

So there are at least two issues, one is the lack of truncation of
register value done by the callee, which is a psABI violation.  The
other is clang not resetting the high bits of the register when the
altcall is inside a loop construct.  In the godbolt example provided
the high bits of %rdi are not cleared between loops.  This last issue
would also be 'fixed' if clang implemented the psABI properly and
truncated the register at the callee.

I've given a try in godbolt, and odd structure sizes seem to be
affected:

https://godbolt.org/z/778YsoWsn

We have no usages of such structures in Xen so far.

The only way I've found to cope with this is to use something like:

#define ALT_CALL_ARG(arg, n)                                            \
    union {                                                             \
        typeof(arg) e[(sizeof(long) + sizeof(arg) - 1) / sizeof(arg)];  \
        unsigned long r;                                                \
    } a ## n ## __  = {                                                 \
        .e[0] = ({ BUILD_BUG_ON(sizeof(arg) > sizeof(void *)); (arg); })\
    };                                                                  \
    register unsigned long a ## n ## _ asm ( ALT_CALL_arg ## n ) =      \
        a ## n ## __.r

An oversized array that ensures all the space of the long is covered
by the array, but then we need an extra variable, as we would
otherwise require modifying ALT_CALL{0..6}_OUT to use aX_.r instead of
aX_.

Thanks, Roger.

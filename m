No, it can't.

See the very start of SDM Chapter 25 "VMEntries" for the distinction
between early and late entry failures.Â  (i.e. those which cause
execution to continue beyond VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME, and those which cause
execution to continue from the vmexit handler.)

Early failures are conditions such as `pop %ss; vmlaunch`, and bad host
state in the VMCS.

Everything pertaining to guest state is late failure, so by the time we
get to processing the MSR load/save list, we're definitely not taking
this path.

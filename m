You will need to link xen_xenmap[] in boot_second[...] as well. With 
that, you will be able to access the new Xen through the temporary area.

You should be able to use map_domain_page() to map the page where 
init_ttbr is.

The goal is to have everything used (code, data) before the MMU is 
turned on residing in a single page. So secondary CPUs can directly jump 
to the colored Xen without any trouble.

Secondary CPUs would directly start on the colored Xen. So they will be 
able to access the "new" init_ttbr & co.

We already have a section for that in place (see .idmap.*) which happens 
to be at the beginning of Xen. Right now, the section is in text. Which 
is why it is read-only executable.

We should not need this. Secondary boot CPUs should boot direclty on the 
colored Xen.

No worries. I am happy to go in as much details as necessary. I can also 
attempt to write a patch if that helps. (unless someone else in the Arm 
maintainers want to give a try).

Well, a subsequent patch adds a config option for this, which in
the worst case could be turned off. I'm afraid though I'm not
clear about the question, because ...

... it's not clear to me what the implications here are: Are you
saying -no-integrated-as is not going to function anymore, unless
people explicitly install gas? If that's not what you meant to
indicate, then I don't see how building would become impossible.

Depending on the situation as a whole, we might then be in need
of a 2nd config option...

And btw, good that you pointed me back at this: The v3 change
wasn't quite complete, since we now don't need to check for
proper \(text) handling anymore in our logic to establish
CLANG_FLAGS. I've dropped that part for v4.

Yes - see patches later in the series, which take care of the anomaly.

I think we could, but have you found similar assertions
elsewhere? There being any fields would, aiui, indicate a syntax
violation (or else $level can't be 2), and I'd rather leave
catching these to the compiler.

I don't think it would, as it continues handling struct/union
just fine. (We may want to drop this support, to enforce no
use of only typedef-s, but I'm not sure _that_ wouldn't
explode.)

Complexity: Yes. Zero value - surely not. I'm having a hard time seeing
why you may think so. Would you mind explaining yourself?

One is better than nothing, but still pretty little.

Neither do I. Then we'd also switch STAC/CLAC to MAYBE_STAC / MAYBE_CLAC.

Everything? I don't see why the #ifdef-s are semantically relevant
(the needed infor is already conveyed by the ALTERNATIVE and its
arguments). I consider them primarily harming readability, and thus I
think we should strive to eliminate them if we can. Hence this patch

So as you have seen I've posted a new version of just the function
alignment patch, that I expected wasn't controversial.

I think there are more subtle cases where it's indeed arguable that
putting it in Kconfig or a Makefile makes no difference from a user
experience PoV, hence in the context here I do believe it wants to be
in Kconfig as LIVEPATCH can be make dependent on it.

I could send a followup afterwards to arrange for the check to be in
Kconfig, but it would feel a bit odd to me this is not done in the
first place.

I don't want to block the patch because I think it's useful, so worst
case I'm willing to give my Ack and provide an alternative Kconfig
based patch afterwards.

Thanks, Roger.

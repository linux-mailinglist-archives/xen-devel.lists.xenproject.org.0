Hi,

Here we go:

https://lore.kernel.org/xen-devel/de46590ad566d9be55b26eaca0bc4dc7fbbada59.1585063311.git.hongyxia@amazon.com/

We have been using the revert for quite a while in production and didn't 
notice any regression.

To be honest, I think this is the other way around. You wrote and merged 
a patch with the following justification:

"
     There is no need to hold the global domctl lock across domain_kill() -
     the domain lock is fully sufficient here, and parallel cleanup after
     multiple domains performs quite a bit better this way.
"

Clearly, the original commit message is lacking details on the exact 
setups and numbers. But we now have two stakeholders with proof that 
your patch is harmful to the setup you claim perform better with your patch.

To me this is enough justification to revert the original patch. Anyone 
against the revert, should provide clear details of why the patch should 
not be reverted.

Cheers,

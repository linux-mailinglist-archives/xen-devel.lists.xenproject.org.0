As you say, we have a flag to mark a transitiong period, the flag is
XEN_RUNSTATE_UPDATE. So, I think it is OK if we don't use atomics during
the transitioning period. But we need to make sure to use atomics for the
update of the XEN_RUNSTATE_UPDATE flag itself.

Does it make sense? Or maybe I misunderstood some of the things you
wrote?

It's quite likely I'm missing something here, but what further
accounting you would like to do?

The current target of the interrupt (->arch.cpu_mask previous to
cpumask_and()) is all going offline, so any attempt to set it in
->arch.old_cpu_mask would just result in a stale (offline) CPU getting
set in ->arch.old_cpu_mask, which previous patches attempted to
solve.

Maybe by "further accounting" you meant something else not related to
->arch.old_{cpu_mask,vector}?

Can do.

Thanks, Roger.

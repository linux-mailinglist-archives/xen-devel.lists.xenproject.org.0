We introduced the new config option [vpci="pci_ecam"] for guests. When this config option is enabled in a guest configuration, a PCI device tree node will be created in the guest device tree.

I think I'm confused, but that file doesn't contain anything related
to the guest physmap, that's the Xen virtual memory layout on Arm
AFAICT?

Does this somehow relate to the physical memory map exposed to guests
on Arm?

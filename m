3e20 is the host bridge ID for CFL-R (Gen 9) Core i9 (8c/16t) as found
in the Dell XPS 15 7590 amongst other things.

As such, it is a generation later than CFL.

Given the nature of issue (a power efficiently "feature" rather than a
bug), it will likely affect everything in a couple of generations worth
of CPUs.

The issue may not actually affect Xen yet, because I don't expect we've
got S0ix working yet.Â  It is only a problem on entry to S0i2/3 where the
HPET is halted.

0x8a12 is an ID in the middle of a load of Ice Lake IDs, according to
the PCI-ID database, but there isn't entry specifically for it.

I can't find a datasheet either for it.

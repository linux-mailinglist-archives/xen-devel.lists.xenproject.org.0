Thanks.

Why? It's only used (and going to be further used) by code not
built for Arm. So while it certainly would be nice for such a
header to also appear there (and the x86-special casing going
away in patch 2), it's not a strict requirement at this point.
Therefore I'd prefer to leave this to the Arm maintainers (and
probably for 4.16).

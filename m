IMO using -ffixed-reg for all those registers is even worse, as that
prevents the generated code in hweight from using any of those, thus
greatly limiting the amount of registers and likely making the
generated code rely heavily on pushing an popping from the stack?

This also has the side effect to limiting the usage of popcnt to gcc,
which IMO is also not ideal.

I also wondered, since the in-place asm before patching is a call
instruction, wouldn't inline asm at build time already assume that the
scratch registers are clobbered?

I would definitely prefer simpler asm for sure, so getting rid of the
prefix would be a clear +1 from me. Unless the prefixed version has a
measurable performance impact during normal operation.

Thanks, Roger.

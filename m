Well, the vector field no longer stores a vector, but an offset into
the Interrupt Remapping table.

IR doesn't change the vector, so pre-IR and post-IR vectors are the
same.

However, the table stores the value of 'raw' IO-APIC RTEs, which would
be the RTEs as written by the IOMMU code (post-IR).  See how IOMMU
code calls __ioapic_write_entry() to update the IO-APIC RTEs to use
the remapped format.

Sure, that's fine to add.

Well, it's the vector field when not using the remapped format, it's
no longer a vector field when using IR on AMD-Vi.  Hence why I've
named it "EOI handle".

It's [apic][pin] matrix.  It's quite common in the IO-APIC code, I didn't
want to make the comment to verbose, but can certainly add to it.

It's -1 which will be ~0, certainly out of the scope of the vectors
range.

The coding style in Xen is to not use fixed width integers unless
strictly necessary (iow: when representing register values for
example).  I don't think it's strictly required here to use a
fixed-width type.

As said above - using 'vector' when using AMD-Vi RTE remapped format is
not accurate IMO.

I think it's possible that some IO-APIC pins are configured before Xen
is started, in which case Xen would need to deal with them.  I didn't
want to break that assumption anyway, if we want to get rid of this
case it should be a separate change.

Could do, overall it seems to make the logic more complicated than
strictly needed.  The allocation is done exclusively once at boot, and
hence doing a single one or possibly 4 or 5 different ones doesn't
seem worth it.  There are not that many IO-APICs on a system.

Thanks, Roger.

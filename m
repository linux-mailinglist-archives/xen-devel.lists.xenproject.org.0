But why? If something is in-use by Xen (e.g. IOMMU, a serial PCI device,
etc.) ideally Dom0 shouldn't even know of its existence because the
device is not exposed to Dom0. Dom0 is not meant to use it. Why let Dom0
know it exists if Dom0 should not use it?

In Xen on ARM, initially we didn't expose devices used by Xen to Dom0
at all.  However to hide them completely we had to make complex device
tree manipulations. Now instead we leave the device nodes in device tree
as is, but we change the "status" property to "disabled".

The idea is still that we completely hide Xen devices from Dom0, but
because of implementation complexity, instead of completing taking away
the corresponding nodes from device tree, we change them to disabled,
which still leads to the same result: the guest OS will skip them.

I am saying this without being familiar with the x86 PVH implementation,
so pardon my ignorance here, but it seems to me that as we are moving
toward an better architecture with PVH, once that allows any OS to be
Dom0, not just Linux, we would want to also completely hide devices
owned by Xen from Dom0.

That way we don't need any workaround in the guest OS for it not to use
them.

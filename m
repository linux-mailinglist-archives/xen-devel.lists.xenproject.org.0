I don't read the spec the same way as you. The property is marked as 
'OR' which means the property is optional but recommended.

Therefore, what you just wrote is enough to justify why we can relax the 
check.

I mean that the binding for the ns16550 in 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings 
should be updated.

I will not accept any code in Xen which use properties that have not 
been accepted by the Linux/Device-Tree community. Unless this is a 
binding "owned" by Xen (e.g. the nodes for dom0less).

In general, this is sending an e-mail to the device-tree mailing with 
your proposal in the form of a patch.

Well yes. But as usual, it depends on your end goal. For instance, we 
would not want to describe the HW on the command line.

Thinking a bit more, in this case, the command line option is probably 
best because you want to override what's describe in the firmware table.

Cheers,

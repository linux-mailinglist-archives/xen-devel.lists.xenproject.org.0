Correct.Â  Much as I'd like this to be backported, it depends on
approximately all the toolstack work I got complete in 4.14.

The changes to xc_apply_cpuid_policy() are only safe because the
behaviour of 4.13 is known (and fixed), and that all versions of Xen
we've made "breaking" default changes have the boot CPUID settings
properly in the migrate stream.

Hi Alex,

Thank you for your feedback!

Hmmmm, the current way to handle MMIO is the following:
     * pause the vCPU
     * Forward the access to the backend domain
     * Schedule the backend domain
     * Wait for the access to be handled
     * unpause the vCPU

So the sequence is going to be fairly expensive on Xen.

vmexit on Xen on Arm is pretty cheap compare to KVM as we don't save a 
lot of things. In this situation, they handling an extra trap for the 
interrupt is likely to be meaningless compare to the sequence above.

I am assuming the sequence is also going to be used by the MSIs, right?

It feels to me that it would be worth spending time to investigate the 
cost of that sequence. It might be possible to optimize the ACK and 
avoid to wait for the backend to handle the access.

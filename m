I miss some of the context of this thread -- let me try to understand
the issue properly.

It looks like HVM reboot doesn't work properly, or is it HVM reset
(in-guest reset)? It looks like it is implemented by calling "xl trigger
reset", which is implemented by libxl_send_trigger. The call chain leads
to a XEN_DOMCTL_sendtrigger domctl with XEN_DOMCTL_SENDTRIGGER_RESET as
a parameter that is not implemented on x86.

That looks like a pretty serious bug :-)


I imagine the reason why it is in that state is that the main way to
reboot would be to call "xl reboot" which is implemented with the PV
protocol "reboot" write to xenstore?  Either way, the bug should be
fixed.

What does your libxl-fix-reboot.patch patch do? Does it add an
implementation of XEN_DOMCTL_SENDTRIGGER_RESET?

The question is addressed to anyone familiar with arm inline assembly.
I added the arm maintainers as primary recipients to this email to make 
this perfectly clear.

When cross-compiling Xen on x86 for arm32 with
asm volatile ("mov sp,%0; b %1" : : "r" (stack), "S" (fn) : "memory" );
compilation fails with the error: impossible constraint in â€˜asm'

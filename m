+# Signaling support between two domUs on dom0less system
+
+## Current state:â€¯Draft version
+
+## Proposer(s): Rahul Singh, Bertrand Marquis
+
+## Problem Statement:
+
+The goal of this work is to define a simple signaling system between Xen guests
+in dom0less systems.
+
+In dom0less system, we cannot make use of xenbus and xenstore that are used in
+normal systems with dynamic VMs to communicate between domains by providing a
+bus abstraction for paravirtualized drivers.
+
+One possible solution to implement the signaling system between domUs is based
+on event channels.
+
+## Proposal:
+
+Event channels are the basic primitive provided by Xen for event notifications.
+An event channel is a logical connection between 2 domains (more specifically
+between dom1,port1 and dom2,port2). They essentially store one bit of
+information, the event of interest is signalled by transitioning this bit from
+0 to 1. An event is an equivalent of a hardware interrupt.
+
+Notifications are received by a guest via an interrupt from Xen to the guest,
+indicating when an event arrives (setting the bit). Further notifications are
+masked until the bit is cleared again. When a domain wants to wait for data it
+will block until an event arrives, and then send an event to signal that data
+has been consumed. Events are delivered asynchronously to guests and are
+enqueued when the guest is not running.
+
+Event channel communication will be established statically between two domU
+guests before unpausing the domains after domain creation. Event channel
+connection information between domUs will be passed to XEN via device tree
+node.
+
+Under the /chosen node, there needs to be sub nodes with compatible
+"xen,evtchn" that descibes the event channel connection between two domUs.
+
+The event channel sub-node has the following properties:
+
+- compatible
+
+    "xen,evtchn"
+
+- xen,evtchn
+
+    The property is four numbers of tuples of
+    (local-port-domU1,domU1-phandle,local-port-domU2,domU2-phandle) where:
+
+    local-port-domU1 is an integer value that will be used to allocte local
+    port for domU1 to send an event notification to the remote domain.
+
+    domU1-phandle is a single phandle to an domain to which local-port-domU1
+    will be allocated.
+
+    local-port-domU2 is an integer value that will be used to allocte local
+    port for domU2 to send an event notification to the remote domain.
+
+    domU2-phandle is a single phandle to an domain to which local-port-domU2
+    will be allocated.
+
+Example:
+
+    chosen {
+        ....
+
+        domU1: domU1 {
+            ......
+        };
+
+        domU2: domU2 {
+            ......
+        };
+
+        evtchn@1 {
+            compatible = "xen,evtchn";
+            xen,evtchn = <0xa &domU1 0xb &domU2>;
+        };
+
+        evtchn@2 {
+            compatible = "xen,evtchn";
+            xen,evtchn = <0xc &domU1 0xd &domU2>;
+        };
+    };
+
+In above example two event channel comunication will be established between
+domU1 and domU2.
+
+    domU1 (port 0xa) <-----------------> domU2 (port 0xb)
+    domU1 (port 0xc) <-----------------> domU2 (port 0xd)
+
+domU1 and domU2 can send the signal to remote domain via hypercall
+EVTCHNOP_send(.) on local port.

I understand that and I don't mind which definition is chosen. I just 
want the documentation to be clear enough so there is little to no 
interpretation left.

If you decide to move setup_page_tables() just close to setup_mm(). 
Then, I think the call should be moved to setup_mm().

I will have a look at the rest of the series and come back to this point.

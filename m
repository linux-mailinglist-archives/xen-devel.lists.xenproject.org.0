Yes, but that's expected and required, because when using VMX LAPIC
virtualization you get an explicit vmexit (EXIT_REASON_EOI_INDUCED) on
EOI of requested vectors by using the EOI exit bitmap
(vmx_update_eoi_exit_bitmap).

OK, the callback can be certainly cleared in vlapic_handle_EOI.

So my callback model for the vIO-APIC/vPIC is different from the one
used for the vlapic. In that case callers must use a helper to
register/remove a callback for GSIs, and a single GSI can have
multiple callbacks attached.

Such interface works well with the vIO-APIC/vPIC because interrupts
from devices are statically assigned a GSI, and you only need to
register the callback when the device is instantiated.

For vlapic OTOH this would be more complex, as a guest might decide to
change MSI vectors constantly and thus require a non-trivial amount of
registrations/removals of callbacks.

I was assuming that any sane OS wouldn't share a lapic vector for
multiple devices, and that hence we could get away without having to
implement multiple per-vector callback support.

Would you be fine with clearing the callback in vlapic_handle_EOI and
then vlapic_set_irq_callback complaining if it finds there's a
previous callback different than the one provided already set for the
to be injected vector?

Thanks, Roger.

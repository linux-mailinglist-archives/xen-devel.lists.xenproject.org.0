That's an implementation detail, you can certainly map the pages
eagerly, or even map multiple contiguous pages as a result of a single
p2m violation.

I would focus on making a functioning prototype first, performance
comes afterwards.

You can, indeed, but it's cumbersome?  You might have to map the page
in the context of the entity that implements the ioreq server to
access the data.  Allowing retries would be more generic, and reduce
the code in the ioreq server handler, that would only map the page
to the guest p2m and request a retry.

Maybe I'm not getting the question right, all Xen modifications to the
p2m take immediate effect.  By the time a XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping
hypercall returns the operation would have taken effect.

With some trickery you could likely use XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping to
add and remove those pages.  You will need calls to
XEN_DOMCTL_iomem_permission beforehand so that you grant the receiving
domain permissions to access those (and of course the granting domain
needs to have full access to them).

This is no ideal if mapping RAM pages, AFAICT there are no strict
checks that the added page is not RAM, but still you will need to
handle RAM pages as IOMEM so and grant them using
XEN_DOMCTL_iomem_permission which is not great.  Also note that this
is a domctl, so not stable.  It might however be enough for a
prototype.

Long term I think we want to expand XENMEM_add_to_physmap{,_batch} to
handle this use-case.

Hm, as said above, while you could possible handle RAM as IOMEM, it
has the slight inconvenience of having to add such RAM pages to the
d->iomem_caps rangeset for XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping to succeed.

From a guest PoV, it doesn't matter if the underlying page is RAM or
MMIO, as long as it's mapped in the p2m.

As long as you give the destination domain access to the page using
XEN_DOMCTL_iomem_permission prior to the XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping
call it should work.

How does this work for device DMA accesses?  If the device is assigned
to the backend domain (and thus using the backend domain IOMMU context
entry and page-tables) DMA accesses cannot be done against guest
provided addresses, there needs to be some kind of translation layer
that filters commands?

My initial recommendation would be to look into what you can do with
the existing XEN_DOMCTL_iomem_permission and XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping
hypercalls.

Updates of p2m PTEs are always atomic.

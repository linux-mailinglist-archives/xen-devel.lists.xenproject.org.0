Looking at what you provided below, it is still unclear what you mean by 
"Xen USB 3.0 driver". By any chance, are you confused with the "x" in xhci?

The drivers "xhci_hcd" and "xhci_pci" are generic and not 
provided/maintained by Xen. So far, with the information provided, it is 
unclear whether the problem is actually in the driver itself. I have a 
few more questions. See below.

Thanks for the clarification. IIUC, you said you are having problem in 
the guest itself. Have you tried to access the same USB device from 
dom0? Or better without any Xen involved (i.e. booting Debian on baremetal).

This would help to narrow down the issue.

IIUC, before you said you had problem with Windows. So is this the 
software in dom0? Or did you actually try with Debian and still see the 
same issue?

Regarding the configuration, given you are using the official Debian 
package. Are you using 'xl' to create your guest?

The ideal would be if you can paste the full configuration. If you can't 
can you tell us if you are using any of these options: 'pci', 'usbdev', 
'usbctrl'?

Newer Xen releases should be compatible with Debian 11. But I am not 
aware of any "official" package for that specific version.

With some further work to separate headers in e.g. Xen's acpi/
into ones to be exposed and ones not to be exposed, this
would likely be an option. It's not clear to me though how you
mean to deal with libelf.h and elfstructs.h. Nor is it clear
how we'd deal with x86's cpuid-autogen.h, which needs to have
distinct instances in the two subtrees.

And of course the present full exposure of asm-x86 rather wants
limiting than setting in stone by using -I to point into the
hypervisor tree.

Installing of the headers into dist/ will also need re-working
then.

Taking things together - no, I don't think I'm up to doing this,
yet I think the series presented is an improvement.

No, that was the secondary observation. The crash was when reading
MSR_K8_TSEG_ADDR. See my patch'es description.

Handling this on an MSR-by-MSR basis is what Andrew suggested when
I first posted that patch. I continue to not agree, because even if
we limited our auditing to just a single Linux version, how could
we be sure to catch all cases (including rarely taken paths)? IOW I
think auditing isn't a workable approach, and waiting for bug
reports isn't one either.

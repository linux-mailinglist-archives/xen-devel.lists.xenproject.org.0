Please can you finally get into the habit of not sending rude replies?

I'm sorry, but I didn't break things. I made things more consistent with
the earlier change, as pointed out before: With your revert,
evtchn_status() is now (again) inconsistent with e.g. evtchn_send(). If
you were serious about this being something that needs leaving to XSM,
you'd have adjusted such further uses of consumer_is_xen() as well. But
you aren't. You're merely insisting on lsevtchn needing to continue to
work in a way it should never have worked, with a patch to improve the
situation already pending.

Just to state a very basic principle here again: Xen-internal event
channels ought to either be fully under XSM control when it comes to
domains attempting to access them (in whichever way), or they should
truly be Xen-internal, with access uniformly prevented. To me the
former option simply makes very little sense.

No, pending objections are pending objections. Daniel's responses didn't
eliminate them.

As a separate aspect: I can't assume anymore that it is just coincidence
that you taking such a controversial action is at a time when I'm away.

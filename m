I also already had to write a patch almost exactly like this one to
provide to customers a few months back.

I have never used PMU directly myself, only provided a patch similar to
this one.  But as far as I could tell the users were fully satisfied
with it and it had no interrupts support either. Could it be that
interrupts are not actually needed to read the perf counters, which is
probably what users care about?

In regards to "this should be a per domain knob", in reality if you are
doing PMU experiments you don't care if only one or all domains have
access: you are working in a controlled environment trying to figure out
if your setup meets the timing requirements. There are no security or
safety concerns (those are different experiments) and there is no
interference problems in the sense of multiple domains trying to access
PMU at the same time -- you control the domains you decide which one is
accessing them.

So I am in favor of a patch like this one because it actually satisfy
our requirements. Even if we had per-domain support and interrupts
support, I don't think they would end up being used.

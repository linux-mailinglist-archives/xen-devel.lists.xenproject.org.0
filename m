Both when seeing this patch's title and when ripping the write part
out of my patch I meant to indicate the same - dealing with just
reads may not be enough. Arguably people could be told to first try
with just relaxing rdmsr handling, but ones anxious to get their
VMs back into production use may ignore such an advice and use the
bigger hammer right away.

I think considering how critical it is that we get things right (as
in "secure"), we should fail booting by default (with a way to
override this) if the value found is reserved (as far as we can
tell).

But no matter how they do it, in principle it is the kernel's
responsibility aiui. I.e. they could sign the entire initrd, or
they could sign all the relevant pieces inside it.

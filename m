I know you are likely not OK with those, so I wasn't expecting input
from you.  We had discussions in the past where people complained that
our defaults are not OK because they lead to errors and panics on
production systems, and I'm surprised to find that none seem to have
cared about the above patches that attempt to address at least part of
this.

Yes, indeed not all.  I don't carry those either on the FreeBSD
packages.

Thanks, Roger.

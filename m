Ah good point. I originally moved the is_ignored check after the 
callback because the socket connection can in theory be closed from 
can_{read, write}.

However, in pratice, is_ignored is only set for socket from 
ignore_connection() that will also close the socket.

The new use will only set is_ignored for the domain connection. So I am 
guessing moving the check early on ought to be fine.

The alternative would be to call ignore_connection() but this feels a 
bit weird because most of it would be a NOP as we are introducing the 
domain.

Cheers,

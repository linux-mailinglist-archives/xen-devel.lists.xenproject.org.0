In this case, use of VMID could be dropped and just flush the guest TLB before entering
domain. Not efficient, but still an option.

Good point, I thought about that too.

I don't believe anyone will use RV32.
For RV64, the available ID space seems sufficiently large.

However, if it turns out that the value isn't large enough even for RV64,
I can rework it to manage IDs per physical CPU.
Wouldn't that approach result in more TLB entries being flushed compared

                <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">Right, I just phrased my question poorlyâ€”sorry about that.

What I meant to ask is: does the approach described above actually depend on whether
VMIDs are allocated per-domain or per-pCPU? It seems that the main advantage of
allocating VMIDs per-pCPU is potentially reducing the number of TLB flushes,
since it's more likely that a platform will have more than|VMID_MAX| domains than
|VMID_MAX| physical CPUsâ€”am I right?

              </blockquote>
              <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">Seeing that there can be systems with hundreds or even thousands of CPUs,
I don't think I can agree here. Plus per-pCPU allocation would similarly
get you in trouble when you have only very few VMID bits.
</pre>
            </blockquote>
            <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">But not so fast as in case of per-domain allocation, right?

I mean that if we have only 4 bits, then in case of per-domain allocation we will
need to do TLB flush + VMID re-assigning when we have more then 16 domains.

But in case of per-pCPU allocation we could run 16 domains on 1 pCPU and at the same
time in multiprocessor systems we have more pCPUs, which will allow us to run more
domains and avoid TLB flushes.
On other hand, it is needed to consider that it's unlikely that a domain will have
only one vCPU. And it is likely that amount of vCPUs will be bigger then an amount
of domains, so to have a round-robin approach (as x86) without permanent ID allocation
for each domain will work better then per-pCPU allocation.

IIUC, x86 allocates VMIDs per physical CPU (pCPU) "dynamically" â€” these are just
sequential numbers, and once VMIDs run out on a given pCPU, there's no guarantee
that a vCPU will receive the same VMID again.

On the other hand, RISC-V currently allocates a single VMID per domain, and that
VMID is considered "permanent" until the domain is destroyed. This means we are
limited to at most VMID_MAX domains. To avoid this limitation, I plan to implement
a round-robin reuse approach: when no free VMIDs remain, we start a new generation
and begin reusing old VMIDs.

The only remaining design question is whether we want RISC-V to follow a global
VMID allocation policy (i.e., one VMID per domain, shared across all of its vCPUs),
or adopt a policy similar to x86 with per-CPU VMID allocation (each vCPU gets its
own VMID, local to the CPU it's running on).

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">
Besides what JÃ¼rgen has said, what would this mean if you have 16 VMIDs and a 17th
domain appears? You can't "take away" the VMID from any domain, unless you fully
suspended it first (that is, all of its vCPU-s).</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>In this case, use of VMID could be dropped and just flush the guest TLB before entering
domain. Not efficient, but still an option.

        <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">Each policy has its own trade-offs. But in the case where the number of available
VMIDs is small (i.e., low VMIDLEN), a global allocation policy may be more suitable,
as it requires fewer VMIDs overall.

So my main question was:
What are the advantages of per-pCPU VMID allocation in scenarios with limited VMID
space, and why did x86 choose that design?

 From what I can tell, the benefits of per-pCPU VMID allocation include:
- Minimized inter-CPU TLB flushes â€” since VMIDs are local, TLB entries donâ€™t need
   to be invalidated on other CPUs when reused.
- Better scalability â€” this approach works better on systems with a large number
   of CPUs.
- Frequent VM switches donâ€™t require global TLB flushes â€” reducing the overhead
   of context switching.
However, the downside is that this model consumes more VMIDs. For example,
if a single domain runs on 4 vCPUs across 4 CPUs, it will consume 4 VMIDs instead
of just one.

      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">
I don't understand this, nor why it's a downside. Looking at a domain as a whole
simply doesn't make sense in this model. Or if you do, then you need to consider
the system-wide number of VMIDs you have available:
(1 &lt;&lt; VMIDLEN) * num_online_cpus(). That is, in your calculation a domain with
4 vCPU-s may indeed use up to 4 VMIDs at a time, but out of a pool at least 4
times the size of that of an individual pCPU.</pre>

    <pre>Good point, I thought about that too.

At least prior to 67e1c050e36b the specification in blkif.h and (what
I consider) the reference implementation in Linux blk{front,back}
matched.  Previous to 67e1c050e36b blkif.h stated:

/*
 * NB. first_sect and last_sect in blkif_request_segment, as well as
 * sector_number in blkif_request, are always expressed in 512-byte units.
 * However they must be properly aligned to the real sector size of the
 * physical disk, which is reported in the "physical-sector-size" node in
 * the backend xenbus info. Also the xenbus "sectors" node is expressed in
 * 512-byte units.
 */

I think it was quite clear, and does in fact match the implementation
in Linux.

As said to Anthony, how do we deal with disks with 4K logical sectors?
I'm not really up for implementing read-modify-write in blkback on
Linux, as it would be complex, slow, and likely prone to errors.

We could introduce a new feature (`logical-sector-size` or some such?)
to expose a sector size != 4K, but we might as well just fix existing
implementations to match with the specification, as that's overall
less changes.

In kernel Linux blk{front,back} have always worked fine with 4K sector
disks, and did match the specification prior to 67e1c050e36b.  Let's
clarify the specification as required and fix the remaining front and
backends to adhere to it.

Thanks, Roger.

Oh, that's odd. How would this help with the VMCB? I thought
you want the VMCB field checked (which is what we're going to
have host state loaded from, and which hence is what shouldn't
be wrong). If the assert as you suggests passes, it means
nothing towards our environment after the next VM exit.

Right, but the assertion should be useful at least in some way,
which may make it unavoidable to duplicate some of the logic.
In effect the assertion as you're suggesting it does, too, in
that it further implies VMCB.trsel == TSS_SELECTOR.

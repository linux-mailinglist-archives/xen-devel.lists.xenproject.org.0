This only differs from what the tool is doing by the fact it applies
the following rule: *IndentWidth: 4*, e.g. it has indented your construct
by 4 spaces, see [1]. Which, IMO, is acceptable change.

I believe this can be stated around the fact that we need to indent,
e.g. apply the same rule as for other constructs already in use

Agree, the existing coding style document will require some extension:
at least clarifications and addition of the rules not described yet.

Not sure it is possible with any tool at all: it just makes the changes
without distinguishing what can be skipped or not even if it does not
violate the rules. It will always seek to improve or "improve" the
code

Well, you already have the answer: only human or AI? Obviously, this

But this part:
   they must not create address-translation cache entries if those entries
   would have been invalidated by any SFENCE.VMA instruction

Doesn't it mean that entries which was invalidated by SFENCE.VMA can't be
inserted into the TLB during speculative execution?

So, if the speculative page walk started before|SFENCE.VMA|,|SFENCE.VMA|
indicates: â€œAll previous TLB entries might be invalid". Therefore, any
speculative TLB entry/that started before/ must*not* be inserted into the
TLB afterward.

So, hardware tracks if a|SFENCE.VMA| occurred/after/ speculation started.
If so, any speculative address translations must be*discarded* or
*not committed*.

Agree with that.

I planned to call it for each hart separately during secondary hart bring-up,
since accessing the|hgatp| register of a hart is required to detect|VMIDLEN|.
Therefore,|vmid_init()| should be called for secondary harts when their
initialization code starts executing.

Yes, it is going to be the only per-hart operation.

There is|__cpu_up()| (not yet upstreamed [1]), which calls
|sbi_hsm_hart_start(hartid, boot_addr, hsm_data)| to start a hart, and I planned
to place|vmid_init()| somewhere in the code executed at|boot_addr|.

            <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">It could be an issue (or, at least, it is recommended) when hgatp.MODE is

   If hgatp.MODE is changed for a given VMID, an HFENCE.GVMA with rs1=x0
   (and rs2 set to either x0 or the VMID) must be executed to order subsequent
   guest translations with the MODE changeâ€”even if the old MODE or new MODE
   is Bare.
On other hand it is guaranteed that, at least, on Reset (and so I assume
for power on) that:
   If the hypervisor extension is implemented, the hgatp.MODE and vsatp.MODE
   fields are reset to 0.

So it seems like if no guest is ran then there is no need even to write
hgatp.MODE as zero, but it might be sense to do that explicitly just to
be sure.

I thought it was possible to have a running guest and perform a CPU hotplug.

above.

If we agreed to keep local_hfence_gvma_all() then I think it isn't really
any sense to restore 'old' or OR-ing it with HGATP_VMID_MASK.

Generally if 'old' is guaranteed to be zero (and, probably, it makes sense
to check that in vmidlen_detect() and panic if it isn't zero) and if
vmidlen_detect() function will be called before any guest domain(s) will
be ran then I could agree that we don't need local_hfence_gvma_all() here.

As an option we can do local_hfence_gvma_all() only if 'old' value wasn't
set to zero.

        </blockquote>
        <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">
I couldn't explicit words that a hart can't speculate into guest mode
either on bring up or during its work.

But there are some moments in the spec which tells:
   Implementations with virtual memory are permitted to perform address
   translations speculatively and earlier than required by an explicit
   memory access, and are permitted to cache them in address translation
   cache structuresâ€”including possibly caching the identity mappings from
   effective address to physical address used in Bare translation modes and
   M-mode.
And here:
   Implementations may also execute the address-translation algorithm
   speculatively at any time, for any virtual address, as long as satp is
   active (as defined in Section 10.1.11). Such speculative executions have
   the effect of pre-populating the address-translation cache.
Where it is explicitly mentioned that speculation can happen in *any time*.
And at the same time:
   Speculative executions of the address-translation algorithm behave as
   non-speculative executions of the algorithm do, except that they must
   not set the dirty bit for a PTE, they must not trigger an exception,
   and they must not create address-translation cache entries if those
   entries would have been invalidated by any SFENCE.VMA instruction
   executed by the hart since the speculative execution of the algorithm began.
What I read as if TLB was empty before it will stay empty.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre wrap="" class="moz-quote-pre">
I read that as "flushing the TLB invalidates entries created by speculative
execution before the TLB flush".</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>But this part:
  they must not create address-translation cache entries if those entries
  would have been invalidated by any SFENCE.VMA instruction

Doesn't it mean that entries which was invalidated by SFENCE.VMA can't be
inserted into the TLB during speculative execution?

So, if the speculative page walk started before <code data-start="1577"
    data-end="1589">SFENCE.VMA</code>, <code data-start="1593"
    data-end="1605">SFENCE.VMA</code>
indicates: â€œAll previous TLB entries might be invalid". Therefore, any
speculative TLB entry <em data-start="1701" data-end="1722">that started before</em> must <strong
    data-start="1728" data-end="1735">not</strong> be inserted into the
TLB afterward.

So, hardware tracks if a <code data-start="1836" data-end="1848">SFENCE.VMA</code> occurred <em
    data-start="1858" data-end="1865">after</em> speculation started.
If so, any speculative address translations must be <strong
    data-start="1941" data-end="1954">discarded</strong> or
<strong data-start="1958" data-end="1975">not committed</strong>.</pre>

There are two part in the problem here:
   1) Code duplication
   2) The SMMUv3 not checking the command line and calling 
arch_iommu_hwdom_init(d)

I agree that 1) can be deferred because it is a clean-up. However, I 
consider 2) a (latent) bug because it means that we risk unintentionally 
breaking the SMMUv3 driver is we need to add code in 
arch_iommu_hwdom_init() as part of a future bug fix for 4.15.

Therefore...

> Yes if there is a need for v6 I will add the arch_iommu_hwdom_init(d) in arm_smmu_iommu_hwdom_init().

... I think calling arch_iommu_hwdom_init() should be the strict 
minimum. So please address it. Although, no need to resend the full 
series, you can only resend patch #10.

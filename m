Possibly - I didn't try yet, simply because of fearing this might
not be liked even without presenting it in patch form.

No idea whether there is any such "reliable" value.

This could be the hope, yes. But the effort of auditing the code to
confirm the potential of optimizing this (after vaguely getting the
impression there might be room) was non-negligible (in fact I did
three runs just to be really certain). This in particular means
that I'm in no way certain that looking at existing consumers would
point out the possible pitfall.

By "all this trouble", do you mean the outlined further steps or
the patch itself? In the latter case, while it's only the BSP to
read the value, all other CPUs are waiting for the BSP to get its
part done. So the extra time it takes to read the platform clock
affects the overall duration of the rendezvous, and hence the time
not "usefully" spent by _all_ of the CPUs.

Not really, no. /basevideo needs evaluating very early in any event,
before any (regular) output gets produced. /mapbs could be parsed
later, but the early boot code intentionally does not make any
attempt at parsing the command line options designated for the
common parts of xen.gz and xen.efi. Yet the map_bs variable has one
use in early boot code (i.e. before handing over to __start_xen()).

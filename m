Why? Specifically, why should people use only one entirely nailed down
configuration for a shim. Like a "normal" hypervisor, there are aspects
which very well can be left to the person doing the configuration.

Well - if so, why would we do this in some cases but not in others?
You may recall that I'm a proponent of consistency and predictability.

FTAOD - you mean Kconfig-wise? Andrew clearly didn't say "nothing", but
"nothing other than making the boolean be a compile time constant".

Why do you say "adding"? We have this already.

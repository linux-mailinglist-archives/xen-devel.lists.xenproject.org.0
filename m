Can either of you tell why this is? As said before, qemu shouldn't
start tearing down ioreq servers until the domain has made it out
of all shutdown deferrals, and all its vCPU-s have been paused.
For the moment I think the proposed changes, while necessary, will
mask another issue elsewhere. The @releaseDomain xenstore watch,
being the trigger I would consider relevant here, will trigger
only once XEN_DOMINF_shutdown is reported set for a domain, which
gets derived from d->is_shut_down (i.e. not mistakenly
d->is_shutting_down).

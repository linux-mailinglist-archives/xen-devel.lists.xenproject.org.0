Hi Jinjie,

I was a bit confused by this, as I didn't see the link with the generic 
entry
given you implement `raw_irqentry_exit_cond_resched()` in arch/arm64
as well in this patch : I expected the arm64 implementation to be added.
I share more thoughts below.

What do you think about something along those lines ?

	Compared to the generic entry code, arm64 does additional checks
	when deciding to reschedule on return from an interrupt.
	Introduce arch_irqentry_exit_need_resched() in the need_resched() condition
	of the generic raw_irqentry_exit_cond_resched(), with a NOP default.
	This will allow arm64 to implement its architecture specific checks when
	switching over to the generic entry code.

Very nit : "to check if resched is needed." ?

If feel that "to avoid preemption of a task" instead of "to skip preempt 
a task"
would make this much clearer, what do you think ?

I've had some trouble reviewing this patch : on the one hand because
I didn't notice `arch_irqentry_exit_need_resched()` was added in
the common entry code, which is on me !
On the other hand, I felt that the patch itself was a bit disconnected :
we add `arch_irqentry_exit_need_resched()` in the common entry code,
with a default NOP, but in the same function we add to arm64,
while mentioning that this is for arm64's additional checks,
which we only implement in patch 7.

Would it make sense to move theÂ `arch_irqentry_exit_need_resched()`
part of the patch to patch 7, so that the introduction and
arch-specific implementation appear together ?
To me it seems easier to wrap my head around, as it would look like
"Move arm64 to generic entry, but it does additional checks : add a new
arch-specific function controlling re-scheduling, defaulting to true,
and implement it for arm64". I feel it could help making patch 7's
commit message clearer as well.

 From what I gathered on the archive `arch_irqentry_exit_need_resched()`
being added here was suggested previously, so others might not have the
same opinion.

Maybe improving the commit message and comment for this would be enough
as well, as per my suggestions above.


Otherwise the changes make sense and I don't see any functional issues !

Thanks,
Ada

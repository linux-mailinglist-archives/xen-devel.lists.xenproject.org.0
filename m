It would allow to deal with cases when a guest is suddenly unable to boot after hypervisor update (especially from pre-4.14). It won't help in all cases since some MSRs may be expected to be non-zero but I think it will cover large number of them. (and it will certainly do what Jan is asking above but will not be specific to this particular breakage)

This would re-introduce the problem with detection (by guests) of certain
features lacking suitable CPUID bits. Guests would no longer observe the
expected #GP(0), and hence be at risk of misbehaving. Hence at the very
least such an option would need to be per-domain rather than (like for
KVM) global, and use of it should then imo be explicitly unsupported. And
along the lines of what KVM has, this may want to be a tristate so the
ignoring can be both silent and verbose.

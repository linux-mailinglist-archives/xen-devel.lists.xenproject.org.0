Right, Linux will pre-fault and lock the pages before using them for
IO, and unlock them afterwards, in which case it should be safe.

Should work, on FreeBSD privcmd I also populate the pages in the page
fault handler, but the hypercall to create the foreign mappings is
executed only once when the ioctl is issued.

Urg, OK, that's a shame as using mwait-idle was IMO better from a Xen
PoV as we didn't rely on dom0 in order to discover C states. I wonder
if we could continue to update mwait-idle on our own for newer models.

FWIW, wikichip also lists 6c and 6a [0] as Ice Lake Server model versions,
but I'm not sure if this has been confirmed in any way?

Roger.

With you deriving from d->grant_table->max_grant_frames, this approach
would imply that by obtaining a mapping the grant tables will get
grown to their permitted maximum, no matter whether as much is actually
needed by the guest. If this is indeed the intention, then we could as
well set up maximum grant structures right at domain creation. Not
something I would favor, but anyway...

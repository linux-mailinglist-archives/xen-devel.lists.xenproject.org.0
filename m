Did you intend to add a newline before the second sentence?

I am a bit confused with the description. Are you trying to explain the 
event channel in layman term? If not, then event channel protocol is 
more complicated than that (in particular for fifo).

I think "masked" is confusing here.

The event channel differentiate "mask" vs "pending". When sending an 
event, the pending bit will be set to 1. If it wasn't already pending 
and the mask bit is clear, then we will notify the guest.

If the pending bit is already set, then we will ignore.

In fact, the event channel is acting similarly to an edge interrupt. I 
wrote similarly, because IIRC they are behaving slightly differently 
(see [1] for more details).

s/guest/domain/ to stay consistent and also include dom0/hardware domain.

Why are we limiting ourself to domUs?

This is quite difficult to read. Can we add some space before/after each 
comma?

The port will be used for sending but also receiving event notification.

Also, I would suggest to replace "remote domain" with "domU2". So it is 
more explicit.

s/an domain/a domain/ I think.

Same as above for "remote domain".

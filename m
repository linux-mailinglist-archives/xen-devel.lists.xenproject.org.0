I was providing a use-case that was crafted, just not implemented. I 
have not looked at SRIOV in some time and not at the level necessary to 
determine this, but I would be uneasy thinking a VF could just be 
released from a guest to be reassigned either to the host hardware 
domain, aka Supervisor VP, or another guest. Perhaps a reset of the VF 
is enough or it might need more, I have not looked at the details at 
this point since we are still ages away from Xen being exactly capable 
of really doing a true implementation of the SVP architecture.

As mentioned in the other response, the PF is in a higher trusted domain 
level than where the VFs would be assigned.

In the SVP architecture, there is more than one "hardware domain".

I think you misundertood my point here. I wasn't necessarily saying that 
the name "modules" was meaningful. Instead, I was pointing out there was 
various nodes without compatible property. I can see how this is useful 
to group nodes.

In fact, I couldn't find a section in the Device-Tree suggesting that 
the compatible property was mandatory. Do you have one pointer in hand?

See above, I wasn't suggesting that the name "soc" is meaningful.

Nothing in hand sorry. I vaguely recall we had that discussion when 
introducing the partial device-tree a few years ago.

To expand what I wrote above, I viewed "modules" as just a way to group 
nodes rather than a meaningful name.

In the current implementation in Xen doesn't care of the name. It just 
looks for any node in chosen up to depth 3. So anyone could create a 
node "bar" to group everything together.

I am not really in favor of introducing a new compatible because it will 
never be used by Xen (or anyone else).

So if the compatible is mandatory, then I would prefer to deprecate the 
use in the next release (we could add a warning).

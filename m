Hi Mykola,

First, since you used a different email account to send you patch, the
email should start with "From: Mykola ... <...@epam.com>" so that
`git am` can set the correct author for the commit. Often
`git send-email` managed to do that automatically, if it knows that the
author of the email is going to be different than the author of the
commit been sent.

On resume from suspend, does Xen expect a ping from the guest? Or is the
watchdog only rearmed on the first ping from the guest after been
resumed?

So there's already watchdog driver in Linux, why not activate it with
systemd, since it knows how to do it? I almost want to to remove the
service file and redirect users to use systemd's watchdog instead, in
the documentation.

This is the wrong directory, I have no idea what "$(XEN_SYSTEMD_DIR)/.."
could be, even if it's likely to be systemd's directory.
$(XEN_SYSTEMD_DIR) should only be used for system unit files, because
that's how it is defined.

Another comment, from `man 8 systemd-suspend.service`:

    Note that scripts or binaries dropped in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ are
    intended for local use only and should be considered hacks. If
    applications want to react to system suspend/hibernation and resume,
    they should rather use the Inhibitor interface[1].

    [1] https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/inhibit

So is a script in system-sleep the right way?
We probably don't want to go the "inhibitor" way that the manual
suggest, as this would add many dependencies to the daemon (and it's
probably not needed).

How about enhancing xen-watchdog.service to deal with suspend?
It's possible to have "Conflicts=sleep.target" which mean stop this unit
when doing suspend. But restarting the unit on resume seems to need a
second service file which might be a bit more complicated to write,
something like:
    [Unit]
    After=sleep.target
    [Service]
    ExecStart=systemctl restart xen-watchdogd
    [Install]
    WantedBy=suspend.target
    WantedBy=hibernate.target
    WantedBy=hybrid-sleep.target
    WantedBy=suspend-then-hibernate.target
    ...
Actually, I'm not sure After=sleep.target is going to work... we should
be able to use systemd's watchdog capability instead :-) (which seems to
mean that a driver in Linux for xen's watchdog is needed); Never mind,
I've re-read the patch description and commented there.

Anyway, don't use XEN_SYSTEMD_DIR and introduce a new variable
in "systemd.m4".

I don't think you need a loop for that, `install` is perfectly capable
of installing multiple sources.

This should use $XEN_RUN_DIR

Is this necessary? Use only `logger`, if `echo log` doesn't log anything.

Is this necessary? It seems `systemctl is-active` works fine when the
unit doesn't exist.

Would using `systemctl is-enabled` instead work? It seems to work for a
service on my machine.

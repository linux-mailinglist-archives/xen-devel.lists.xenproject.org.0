Can you point to anything that backs up that assertion. Clouds I've
seen always give you a 64-bit environment, and many OS no longer
even ship 32-bit installable media. I would be surprised if 32-bit
is above very very low single digits usage compared to x86_64.

We do compile test windows in CI via mingw, and we also do build
and unit tests via msys.

Even Windows has dropped 32-bit support though, and so the only
reason we keep 32-bit Windows around is because of Windows 10.
Once a Windows 12 comes along, we'll not need to support 32-bit
Windows either.

With regards,
Daniel

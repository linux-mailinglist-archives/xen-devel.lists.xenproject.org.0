I think this should work

At the time it was introduced as a minor performance improvement and
also because it helped us get the right hooks in place in Linux to
upstream Dom0 support (the MSI/MSI-X setup hooks). The feature came with
a high cost in complexity but it was worth it.

Now that many years have passed, Dom0 support has been in Linux for a
long time, the performance improvement alone is not worth keeping this
complexity in Xen. Especially considering direct interrupt injection is
a feature available in many modern interrupt controllers across arches
(x86, ARM, RISC-V).

I think it is time to get rid of XEN_X86_EMU_USE_PIRQ so that guests
stop using the feature. It is fragile. Removing XEN_X86_EMU_USE_PIRQ is
on my todo list but I welcome anyone doing it.

CCing people working on Xen+VirtIO and IOREQs. Not trimming the original
email to let them read the full context.

My comments below are related to a potential Xen implementation, not
because it is the only implementation that matters, but because it is
the one I know best.

Also, please see this relevant email thread:

I cannot see how this could work for Xen. There is no "handle" to give
to the backend if the backend is not running in dom0. So for Xen I think
the memory has to be already mapped and the mapping probably done by the
toolstack (also see below.) Or we would have to invent a new Xen
hypervisor interface and Xen virtual machine privileges to allow this
kind of mapping.

If we run the backend in Dom0 that we have no problems of course.

One thing I mentioned before to Alex is that Xen doesn't have VMMs the
way they are typically envisioned and described in other environments.
Instead, Xen has IOREQ servers. Each of them connects independently to
Xen via the IOREQ interface. E.g. today multiple QEMUs could be used as
emulators for a single Xen VM, each of them connecting to Xen
independently via the IOREQ interface.

The component responsible for starting a daemon and/or setting up shared
interfaces is the toolstack: the xl command and the libxl/libxc
libraries.

Oleksandr and others I CCed have been working on ways for the toolstack
to create virtio backends and setup memory mappings. They might be able
to provide more info on the subject. I do think we miss a way to provide
the configuration to the backend and anything else that the backend
might require to start doing its job.

Yeah I think, regardless of anything else, we want the backends to
connect directly to the Xen hypervisor.

One option we should consider is for each backend to connect to Xen via
the IOREQ interface. We could generalize the IOREQ interface and make it
hypervisor agnostic. The interface is really trivial and easy to add.
The only Xen-specific part is the notification mechanism, which is an
event channel. If we replaced the event channel with something else the
interface would be generic. See:
https://gitlab.com/xen-project/xen/-/blob/staging/xen/include/public/hvm/ioreq.h#L52

I don't think that translating IOREQs to eventfd in the kernel is a
good idea: if feels like it would be extra complexity and that the
kernel shouldn't be involved as this is a backend-hypervisor interface.
Also, eventfd is very Linux-centric and we are trying to design an
interface that could work well for RTOSes too. If we want to do
something different, both OS-agnostic and hypervisor-agnostic, perhaps
we could design a new interface. One that could be implementable in the
Xen hypervisor itself (like IOREQ) and of course any other hypervisor
too.


There is also another problem. IOREQ is probably not be the only
interface needed. Have a look at
https://marc.info/?l=xen-devel&m=162373754705233&w=2. Don't we also need
an interface for the backend to inject interrupts into the frontend? And
if the backend requires dynamic memory mappings of frontend pages, then
we would also need an interface to map/unmap domU pages.

These interfaces are a lot more problematic than IOREQ: IOREQ is tiny
and self-contained. It is easy to add anywhere. A new interface to
inject interrupts or map pages is more difficult to manage because it
would require changes scattered across the various emulators.

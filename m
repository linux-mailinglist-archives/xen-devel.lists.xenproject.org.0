Thanks.

I don't see it as odd, although I admit that I did try to see if I could
remove multiboot_ptr entirely first.Â  Xen is after all a single
freestanding binary.

Having the debug information (well - at a minimum, ELF size info) is
important for livepatch binary diffing, and nothing in asm by default
gets any of that.

Letting the compiler do this all for us is physically shorter, and less
prone to errors.

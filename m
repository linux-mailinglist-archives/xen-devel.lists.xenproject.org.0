Subject: Violations of MISRA C Rule 20.7 in

Reporting the discussion that took place on Matrix on the matter, so 
that it can carry on here with all interested parties:

> Hi everyone. I was looking at MISRA violations for Rule 20.7 
> ("Expressions resulting from the expansion of macro parameters shall be 
> enclosed in parentheses") generated by
> 
>     #define TRC_PAR_LONG(par) ((uint32_t)(par)), ((par) >> 32)
> 
> The thing here is this: the simplest fix is

>     +#define TRC_PAR_LO(par) ((uint32_t)(par))
>     +#define TRC_PAR_HI(par) ((par) >> 32)

> and then replace all call sites accordingly. However, in certain places 
> (e.g., svm.c:1445), this causes a build error:
> 
>     arch/x86/hvm/svm/svm.c: In function ‘svm_inject_event’:
>     arch/x86/hvm/svm/svm.c:1445:1: error: macro "HVMTRACE_3D" requires 
> 4 arguments, but only 3 given
>     1445 | TRC_PAR_LO(_event.cr2), TRC_PAR_HI(_event.cr2));
>     | ^
>     In file included from arch/x86/hvm/svm/svm.c:31:

> this is due to the somewhat strange definition of HVMTRACE_3D which 
> works with the previous form of the macro, but not the current one, as 
> the macro argument in HVMTRACE_LONG_2D is now split (_LO is d2 and _HI

> I have a proposal: introduce a d3 argument to HVMTRACE_LONG_2D to

Nicola Vetrini:

Andrew Cooper:

George Dunlap:

@gwd: I believe the file that I was concerned about does not fall under 
the XENTRACE entry in MAINTAINERS; you may want to rectify that.

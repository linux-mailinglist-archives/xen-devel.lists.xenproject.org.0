It would need a different testing harness IMO, as the current testing
harness is tied to the offset implementation internals (as it wants to
compare the results of both the fast and slow coefficient
calculations).  I could add a test harness for the mask compression,
but it would be a different file, with slightly different logic, and
hence I don't think it would reduce much the size of this patch.

I've tried to round up both offset and size, but that resulted in no
compression in some cases.  I can try to maybe round just one of
those?

Note that the divide is done once with offset and once with size,
depending on the direction of the translation.  I can explore this a
bit.

On my TGL NUC the cost of the conversion in pfn_to_pdx() measured in
TSC cycles is:

    N           Min           Max        Median           Avg        Stddev
x 2811            26           271            29     39.224831     33.516395

It's from the user-space harness, so might not be fully accurate.  I
the average time for the operation is ~14ns on my specific system
(2800Mhz nominal frequency).

Hm, yes, that might be enough to make the compiler happy about swp()
being unused, I will try it.

I see.  I've been kind of doing that with __XEN__, but it might be
clearer to instead use _TEST_HARNESS_, I could avoid the sed with
that.  I need to see how it looks.

My original idea was that the pdx object could be used by the PDX mask
testing also, but given the algorithm is selected at build time we
would need to generate two different object files from pdx.c anyway.

I could possibly do the filtering from the sanitize function.

Thanks, Roger.

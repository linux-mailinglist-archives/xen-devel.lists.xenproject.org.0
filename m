There are files with intentional Linux coding style inside of xen/,
for example xen/arch/x86/cpu/mwait-idle.c.  We would need a way to
filter those out so that clang-format doesn't attempt to apply the Xen
coding style to them.

Otherwise it needs to be noted possibly in .clang-format that while
the clang-format style will apply by default to all files inside of
xen/, some of those use a different coding style on purpose, and those
should not be reformatted.

We also have some scripts in python and shell inside of both tools/
and scripts/, are those already excluded by clang-format by not having
a .c or .h extension?

Sorry for possibly not fully understanding the purpose and being
stubborn, but IMO consensus should be reached on the email discussion,
so that here you can make a proposal, possibly with a comment
justifying the chosen value.  Just copying excerpts from the email
thread is not likely to help, as I at least find myself completely
lost.

Otherwise if there's no consensus just add a TODO next to the option
explaining why the current setting might not be optimal or the (known)
shortcomings of it, so that we know there's some pending work in this
area.  But it needs to be a concrete list, not pieces from an email
discussion.

Thanks, Roger.

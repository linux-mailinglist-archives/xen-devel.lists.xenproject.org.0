Hi Roger,

See my other reply which is more detailed.  While enabling reads of
"MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS" did not cause any effect in my case, it is one of a
handful of exceptions in which MSRs are writeable but not readable. I believe
this may result in potentially unexpected behavior in  read-check/modify-write
cases.

As such, I now see that my original patch of making these MSRs globally readable
is too lenient and the conditions should likely be restricted to the same as
those in which writes are allowed.

In my particular case, it looks like all my troubles resulted from the BIOS
setting MSR_IA32_THERM_CONTROL to an invalid value and the recent code change
prevented dom0 from seeing (and correcting) it...

Regards,

-Alex

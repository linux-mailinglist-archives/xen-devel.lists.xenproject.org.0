There is an issue with the definition of uint64_t there. Initial
errors like

hvmloader.c: In function 'init_vm86_tss':
hvmloader.c:202:39: error: left shift count >= width of type [-Werror=shift-count-overflow]
  202 |                   ((uint64_t)TSS_SIZE << 32) | virt_to_phys(tss));

already hint at this, but then

util.c: In function 'get_cpu_mhz':
util.c:824:15: error: conversion from 'long long unsigned int' to 'uint64_t' {aka 'long unsigned int'} changes value from '4294967296000000' to '0' [-Werror=overflow]
  824 |     cpu_khz = 1000000ull << 32;

is quite explicit: "aka 'long unsigned int'"? This is a 32-bit
environment, after all. I suspect the build picks up headers
(stdint.h here in particular) intended for 64-bit builds only.
Can you check whether "gcc -m32" properly sets include paths
_different_ from those plain "gcc" sets, if the headers found in
the latter case aren't suitable for the former? Or alternatively
is the Alpine build environment set up incorrectly, in that it
lacks 32-bit devel packages?

As an aside I don't think it's really a good idea to have
hvmloader depend on any external headers. Just like the
hypervisor it's a free-standing binary, and hence ought to be
free of any dependencies on the build/host environment.

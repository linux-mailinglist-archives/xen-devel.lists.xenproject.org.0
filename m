But nothing prevents a user from starting from a shim defconfig, and
then tweaking it as desired:

$ make pvshim_defconfig
$ make menuconfig

Or there's something I'm missing here?

Won't making the boolean a compile time constant would also result in
DCO kicking in and removing a fair amount of code?  So even if you
have enabled everything in Kconfig, the resulting hypervisor would
only be suitable to be used as a shim?

Thanks, Roger.

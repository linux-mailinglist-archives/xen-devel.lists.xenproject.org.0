I am entirely certain you're wrong here, unless maybe you mean solely
comments on patches of yours. There are far too many places where we're
still lacking const, and people are copying such instances far too
blindly.

I am attempting to be quite careful with such requests, but as for any
review comment mistakes / oversights happen. Furthermore relatively
often I put such comments as questions, in the hope to indicates this
way that the change request depends on the result actually building
fine. In fact things not building doesn't necessarily mean the comment
was outright wrong - it often means code elsewhere isn't properly
constified.

My request to all submitters: Constify your patches properly up front.

The problem is that there is no way to distinguish a system that
suffers from GICR LPI tables being immutable from one that allows the
LPI configuration being changed (either because the HW allows it or
because the hypervisor plays other games).

Once you're in the secondary kernel with the RDs enabled, you have
already lost if there is a chance you could have reused this memory,
and that's irrespective of being a guest or bare metal (interrupt
delivery should still work during kexec).

What we could do instead is to have some form of kexec hook that tries
to go and turn the RDs off before jumping into the secondary kernel.
If the hypervisor allows this (and honours the GICR_CTLR.EnableLPI
bit), then there won't be any screaming in the secondary kernel.

This is probably a new infrastructure though, as I don't think we have
anything of the sort at the moment.

Thanks,

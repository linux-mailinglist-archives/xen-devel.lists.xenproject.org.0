I felt it was safer to keep readability via the directmap.

I'm not aware of any logic we have which reads the directmap in order,
but it ought to be possible.

cpu0_stack has already shattered down to 4k, which is likely in the same
superpage as rodata in a non-2M build.

But at the end of the day, it is a security/performance tradeoff.

memcpy(__va(__pa(divide_error)), "\x0f\x0b", 2);
asm ("div %ecx" :: "c" (0));

is an especially low barrier for an attacker who has a partial write gadget.

The security benefits are substantial, and the perf downsides are a
handful of extra pagetables, and a handful of pagewalks taking extra
steps, in non-fast paths (i.e. distinctly marginal).

It occurs to me while writing this that the same applies to livepatches.

It would be all stubs, because there are only 16 protection keys and we
wouldn't want to interleave adjacent stub mappings.

The logic would now be:

pks_allow_write_access();
write new stub;
pks_revoke_write_access();

so as to limit writeability of any stub to just the critical intending
to modify it.

This way, an unrelated buggy hypercall couldn't write into the stub.

I've got a dis-entangled version in my CET series.

https://github.com/andyhhp/xen/commit/8d55e1c8ff1d979c985b3fb75c23627348c15209

which needed some header file adjustments to build.

But yes - I too was thinking that it ought to be committed.

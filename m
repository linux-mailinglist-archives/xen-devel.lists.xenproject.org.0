Could we map/unmap the runtime area on domain switch at a per-cpu
based linear space area? There's no reason to have all the runtime
areas mapped all the time, you just care about the one from the
running vcpu.

Maybe the overhead of that mapping and unmapping would be
too high? But seeing that we are aiming at a secret-free Xen we would
have to eventually go that route anyway.

Oh, that's dull. That hypercall was never noted to be optional, so it
failing would mean Linux has somehow screwed the call which is not
expected.

Like JÃ¼rgen, the purpose of the patch hadn't become clear to me
from reading the description. As I understand it now, we're currently
refusing to boot such a kernel for no reason. If that's correct,
perhaps you could say so in the description in a more direct way?

As far as actual code adjustments go - how much of
elf_xen_addr_calc_check() is actually applicable when booting PVH?

And why is there no bounds check of ->phys_entry paralleling the
->virt_entry one?

On the whole, as long as we don't know what mode we're planning to
boot in, we can't skip any checks, as the mere presence of
XEN_ELFNOTE_PHYS32_ENTRY doesn't mean that's also what gets used.
Therefore simply bypassing any of the checks is not an option. In
particular what you suggest would lead to failure to check
e_entry-derived ->virt_entry when the PVH-specific note is
present but we're booting in PV mode. For now I don't see how to
address this without making the function aware of the intended
booting mode.

(NOLOAD) is meaningless for PE.

That's the convention for ELF, and also what ld defaults to for debugging
sections.

If there were sections at 0, the resulting PE binary would end up broken.
Prior to binutils 2.37 this brokenness is silent, i.e. the linker doesn't
issue any form of diagnostic. The change therefore is addressing a latent
issue - if any such section started being non-empty, we'd be in trouble.

Which binary are you referring to - ELF or PE? In the former case, yes,
that's what the statement is for. In the latter case I can't see how this
would be, with .comment being explicitly part of /DISCARD/ in that case.

> Does the Arm linker script need a similar treatment?

No idea - they don't use ld to produce a PE binary. In fact during my
work on the binutils side for all of this, I was given a hint that on Arm
linking ELF objects into PE output may currently not be possible at all.

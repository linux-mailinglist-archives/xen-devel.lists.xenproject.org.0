Right, but that's now how dom0 is started ATM, as the local APIC is
unconditionally started in xAPIC mode and at APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE.

I could use vlapic_base_address() against vCPU#0 vlapic, but even in
guest_wrmsr_apic_base() we don't allow moving the local APIC MMIO
region, and hence I assumed it was fine to just use
APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE here.  Note in pvh_setup_acpi_madt() Xen also
hardcodes the local APIC address to APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE.

Would you be fine if I expand the comment so it's:

    /* If using an emulated local APIC make sure its MMIO is unpopulated. */
    if ( has_vlapic(d) )
    {
        /* Xen doesn't allow changing the local APIC MMIO window position. */
        mfn = paddr_to_pfn(APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE);
        rc |= iomem_deny_access(d, mfn, mfn);
    }

Urg, that seems ugly.  It would also need undoing if the APICs are
reverted to xAPIC mode?

As said above, for both HVM and PVH Xen doesn't allow moving the APIC
MMIO window to anything different than APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE.

Thanks, Roger.

I'm afraid it hasn't become clear to me which of your further comments
are the "broken corners".

We are doing so already. Just not in this function. And since there
were hex numbers with comments here, I (blindly) added more. I'll submit
a cleanup patch to change the pre-existing ones, and I've already
switched over this and further patches to use the named constants
instead.

That was sitting on top, and I was kind of hoping that I could avoid the
re-basing ahead. But I've meanwhile done so, including the committing of
the result, as you've probably seen.

We already handle modrm_reg 0 and 1 differently. I'm not convinced of
making 7 match 6 without need. We can't predict what Intel will put
there - JMPE (which I'm not really concerned about here, and which
the logic being added also doesn't exclude) already didn't match the
reg/mem16 pattern.

The function writes the full base, but what we retrieved via
protmode_load_seg() is only 32 bits wide. Hence the parenthesization
in the comment. I can add e.g. "zero-extended" if you think that makes
things more clear?

Since you say "all" I can only assume you mean both the write_segment()
and the write_msr(). We need the former, as we replaced the segment
base if protmode_load_seg() succeeded. It's only the write_msr() which
is debatable, yet as indicated that matches SWAPGS handling. I'd like
to keep the two as similar as possible.

Indeed.

Well, I'm looking at this differently anyway: The MSR is merely an alias
for the segment base. Just like LFS/LGS won't trigger respective MSR
intercepts, LKGS shouldn't either.

No, as said - we need to put back the correct base of the "real" GS.

Sure.

I can add that, sure. It just seemed unrelated to me. I wanted to have
FRED to put in place the dependency in gen-cpuid.py. What isn't quite
clear to me is whether there should then also be a dependency recorded
between FRED and NMI_SRC.

This is what I'm meaning to say with the comment. Whereas ...

... this is weaker than what I think is wanted/needed.

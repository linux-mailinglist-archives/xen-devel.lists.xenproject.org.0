Exposing a device to dom0 that won't be functional doesn't seem like a
very wise choice from Xen TBH.

Hm, maybe I'm confused, but if the IOMMU device context entry is set
in pass-through mode ATS won't be enabled and hence no translation
requests would be send from the device?

IOW, devices listed in the SATC can only mandate ATS enabled when the
IOMMU is enforcing translation.   IF the IOMMU is not enabled or if
the device is in passthrough mode then the requirement for having ATS
enabled no longer applies.

Thanks, Roger.

I wouldn't bet on that. Just look at the re-use of opcode D6
(salc in 32-bit) by L1OM for an extreme example. There's nothing
we can say on how any of the reserved opcodes may get re-used.
Prior to AVX / AVX512 we'd have estimated C4, C5, and 62 wrongly
as well (but that's true independent of execution mode).

Do you have any clear, sufficiently simple rule in mind for where
we could draw the boundary?

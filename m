That's entirely reasonable. I understand this is a bug fix, not a

I will take your comments into consideration regarding style before
writing the next version of the patch, and carefully check libxl's
coding style file.

What we are storing as the return value is the starting address,
not the size, of the opregion, and that is a 32-bit value. If we
cannot read it, we return 0xffffffff instead to indicate the error
that we were unable to read the starting address of the opregion
from the config attribute in sysfs. The 32-bit value we are looking for
is read at offset 0xfc from the start of the config attribute of the
Intel IGD in sysfs. The offset 0xfc is defined by PCI_INTEL_OPREGION
both here and in hvmloader (and also in Qemu). The data that is
read at this offset from the start of the config attribute of the Intel
IGD in sysfs is the 32-bit address of the start of the opregion.

That would work also. Please not that I chose that value for an error
value consistent with the way the current function sysfs_dev_get_vendor
does it. While that function does not assign the variable 'error' to
its return value for an error, which in that case is 0xffff because
that function returns uint16_t instead of uint32_t,
I chose to explicitly assign the error variable to that value to help make
the code more readable. YourÂ  comment that this could be a #define
instead is good. I also think we should use a #define for the error return
value of the sysfs_dev_get_vendor function Something like:

#define ERROR_16Â Â Â  0xffff
#define ERROR_32Â Â Â  0xffffffff

might be appropriate. But that would be touching code unrelated to
this bug fix. I think again the libxl maintainers should weigh in about
what to do here. They might let me take this opportunity to update
and improve the style of the patched file in other functions in the
file not related to this bug fix but I am not inclined to do that without
an explicit request from them to do so. So I am not sure yet what I will
do in the next version of the patch, but I will address your concerns here
and try to explain my reasoning for the changes in the changelog for
version 2 of the patch.

I think I followed the same style here as the existing sysfs_dev_get_xxx
functions. I will double check that and use the same style the other
functions use unless they clearly violate the rules, and note that I
deviated from the style of the existing functions to conform to current
coding style and suggest a subsequent patch to update the style of
the other functions.

I will double check how the function being patched handles the return
value. I don't even remember if it has a local variable named rc for a 
return
value. IIRC it was either ret or 0. I understand that libxl expects rc to be
used these days, though. This might be another candidate for updating the
file to libxl's current standards.

I presume you are saying these two lines should be re-written as:

uint32_t igd_opregion;
unti32_t error;

igd_opregion = sysfs_dev_get_igd_opregion(gc, pci);
error = 0xffff;

Please reply if my understanding here is not correct.

I do plan for the next version of the patch to use a #define for
this instead of the error variable (or add 2 to overflow it), so it
will disappear in the next version.

Good points here. I agree about consistency with break and return 0.
I will change this to return 0 and move it to the next line. I do not
want to change the current meaning of the return value
without knowledge of how the caller uses the return value.
IIRC, currently the function always returns 0 unless it encounters a
negative return value from xc_domain_iomem_permission, in which
case it returns that negative value to indicate an error to the caller.
So if we return anything other than 0 here, we might be returning
an error code that the caller does not expect or interpret correctly.
I will also consider putting an error message here before returning 0.
A message something like "dom%d: Intel IGD detected, but could
not find IGD opregion" would explain the error that happens here.
I don't think a non-zero error code to the caller is appropriate here,
though, because, as already mentioned, IIRC this might return a
value the caller does not interpret correctly. If it is necessary to
return an error to the caller here instead of 0, it will be necessary to
ensure all callers of this function will interpret it correctly. I would
suggest an error return value greater than 0 to distinguish it from
the return value < 0 which indicates an error from
xc_domain_iomem_permission, but I hope libxl maintainers will
accept a return value of 0 here, at least for this patch. A later patch
could re-work the return value of this function which would also
probably require touching the caller(s) of this function to properly
respond to this particular error which is different from an error from
xc_domain_iomem_permission. In any case, I will double-check to
see if my current understanding of the meaning of the return value
is correct before writing the next version of the patch. For now, I
will use return 0 instead of break here and move it to the next
line, unless I hear otherwise from the libxl maintainers.

I wrote it that way expecting a compiler error if I didn't do the cast.
I have not checked if the cast is necessary, though, and maybe you
are right. I will check and see if it is necessary by removing the cast
and see if the compiler complains.

If the cast is not needed, I will just use the 32-bit igd_opregion variable
when calling xc_domain_iomem_permission instead of the 64-bit
vga_iomem_start variable. I will remove the three spaces and use a
more descriptive variable instead of re-using vga_iomem_start if the
compiler insists on the cast from 32-bit to 64-bit.

I don't understand how that works either. All my tests have been with
the device model running as a process in dom0. I am thinking maybe
in that case it just uses dom0 for the stub domain, but I have not checked
that. I will check it by dumping the value of stubdom_domid to a log in my
next test.

Thank you for responding promptly. Now I have some work to do writing
the next version of the patch and documenting it clearly in its changelog.
It will take me a while - I will spend enough time on it so hopefully the
libxl maintainers don't have to spend so much time on it.

N.B. I forgot to send this reply to xen-devel and cc the libxl

And cef21210fb133 as well as a6fe79a5979a then. Iirc we had even
talked about this on irc, and were largely in agreement that this
is a little beyond what we'd normally backport.

I have to admit that while I followed Igor's advice that there is
a dependency of his patch on JÃ¼rgen's work, I'm still not really
clear where that dependency actually lies. The patch merely moves
where rcu_barrier() gets invoked from (thus covering previously
uncovered places). If there hadn't been that named dependency, I
would have taken Igor's patch already.

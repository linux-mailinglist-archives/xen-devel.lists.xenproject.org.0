I agree with this. But ...

... I don't understand this one. How is this different from today's 
where a domain can foreign map a 2MB which may be using a superpage in 
the remote domain?

I believe the code was written in a way we could easily introduce 
reference for all the mappings. This has been discussed a few times in 
the past but we never implemented it.

 From any p2m_* functions. On Arm we don't (yet) care about which 
mapping is replaced.

Yes.

I thought about it yesterday. But I came to the conclusion that if we 
have any concern about removing 1GB foreign superpage then we would 
already have the problem today as a domain can map contiguously 1GB 
worth of foreign mapping using small pages.

I went through the various code paths and, I believe, the only concern 
would be if an admin decides to change the values from max_order() using 
the command line option "memop-max-order".

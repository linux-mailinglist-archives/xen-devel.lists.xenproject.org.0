I assumed that originally it meant that from Xen point of view it could be
called guest's virtual as guest doesn't really work with real physical address,
but it seems like it would be more clear to use guest-physical as you suggested
below.

The 2^80 cycles (based on x86-related numbers) result from:
   1. And VM-Entry/-Exit cycle takes at least 1800 cycles (approximated by 2^10)
   2. We have 64 ASIDs (2^6)
   3. 2^64 generations.
I removed this part of the comment earlier because I assumed that the first
item is quite CPU-dependent, even for x86, let alone for other architectures,
which may have a different number (?).
However, this part of the comment was reintroduced during one of the merges.

I havenâ€™t checked how it is done on x86; I probably should.

I planned to call it for each hart separately during secondary hart bring-up,
since accessing the|hgatp| register of a hart is required to detect|VMIDLEN|.
Therefore,|vmid_init()| should be called for secondary harts when their
initialization code starts executing.

All what I was able in RISC-V spec is that:
   The number of VMID bits is UNSPECIFIED and may be zero. The number of
   implemented VMID bits, termed VMIDLEN, may be determined by writing one
   to every bit position in the VMID field, then reading back the value in
   hgatp to see which bit positions in the VMID field hold a one. The least-
   significant bits of VMID are implemented first: that is, if VMIDLEN > 0,
   VMID[VMIDLEN-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of VMIDLEN, termed
   VMIDMAX, is 7 for Sv32x4 or 14 for Sv39x4, Sv48x4, and Sv57x4..
And I couldn't find explicitly that VMIDLEN will be the same across harts.

Therefore, IMO, while the specification doesn't guarantee VMID will be
different, the "unspecified" nature and the per-hart discovery mechanism
of VMIDLEN in the hgatp CSR allows for VMIDLEN to be different on
different harts in an implementation without violating the
RISC-V privileged specification.

Because csr_read() returns unsigned long as HGATP register has
'unsigned long' length.

But it could be done in this way:
     csr_write(CSR_HGATP, old | HGATP_VMID_MASK);
     vmid_bits =  MASK_EXTR(csr_read(CSR_HGATP), HGATP_VMID_MASK);
     vmid_bits = ffs_g(vmid_bits);
     csr_write(CSR_HGATP, old);
And then use uint16_t for vmid_bits and use uin16_t as a return type.

It could be an issue (or, at least, it is recommended) when hgatp.MODE is
changed:
  If hgatp.MODE is changed for a given VMID, an HFENCE.GVMA with rs1=x0
  (and rs2 set to either x0 or the VMID) must be executed to order subsequent
  guest translations with the MODE changeâ€”even if the old MODE or new MODE
  is Bare.
On other hand it is guaranteed that, at least, on Reset (and so I assume
for power on) that:
  If the hypervisor extension is implemented, the hgatp.MODE and vsatp.MODE
  fields are reset to 0.

So it seems like if no guest is ran then there is no need even to write
hgatp.MODE as zero, but it might be sense to do that explicitly just to
be sure.

I thought it was possible to have a running guest and perform a CPU hotplug.
In that case, I expect that during the hotplug,|vmidlen_detect()| will be
called and return the|vmid_bits| value, which is used as the active VMID.
At that moment, the local TLB could be speculatively polluted, I think.
Likely, it makes sense to call vmidlen_detect() only once for each hart
during initial bringup.

It make sense (but I don't know if it is a possible case) to be sure that
HGATP.MODE remains the same, so there is no need to have TLB flush. If
HGATP.MODE is changed then it will be needed to do TLB flush as I mentioned
above.

If we agreed to keep local_hfence_gvma_all() then I think it isn't really
any sense to restore 'old' or OR-ing it with HGATP_VMID_MASK.

Generally if 'old' is guaranteed to be zero (and, probably, it makes sense
to check that in vmidlen_detect() and panic if it isn't zero) and if
vmidlen_detect() function will be called before any guest domain(s) will
be ran then I could agree that we don't need local_hfence_gvma_all() here.

As an option we can do local_hfence_gvma_all() only if 'old' value wasn't
set to zero.

Does it make sense?

Oh, I just noticed that this check isn't even really correct because of
data->max_vmid is inited after this check.

Anyway, build time check would be better.

"VMIDs are disabled" here means that TLB flush will happen each time p2m
is changed.

RISC-V relies on explicit software-managed fence instructions for TLB
flushing.

It seems like vmid_handle_vmenter() should be updated then to return
true if VMIDs are disabled:
   bool vmid_handle_vmenter(struct vcpu_vmid *vmid)
   {
       struct vmid_data *data = &this_cpu(vmid_data);
   
   ...
   
       /*
        * When we assign VMID 1, flush all TLB entries as we are starting a new
        * generation, and all old VMID allocations are now stale.
        */
       return (vmid->vmid == 1);
   
    disabled:
       vmid->vmid = 0;
-      return 0;
+      return true;
   }

Why g_disabled is written only by boot CPU? Does x86 have only two options
or VMIDs are enabled for all CPUs or it is disabled for all of them?

For RISC-V as I mentioned above it is needed to check all harts as the spec.
doesn't explicitly mention that VMIDLEN is equal for all harts...

... Thereby it seems like declaration of g_disabled should be moved outside
vmid_init() function and add a new function which will return g_disabled
value (or just make g_disabled not static and rename to something like
g_vmids_disabled).

And the print message once after all harts will be initialized, somewhere
in setup.c in start_xen() after:
  
for_each_present_cpu ( i )
{
if( (num_online_cpus()< nr_cpu_ids)&& !cpu_online(i))
{

    <pre>The 2^80 cycles (based on x86-related numbers) result from:
  1. And VM-Entry/-Exit cycle takes at least 1800 cycles (approximated by 2^10)

I removed this part of the comment earlier because I assumed that the first

However, this part of the comment was reintroduced during one of the merges.

    </blockquote>
    <pre>All what I was able in RISC-V spec is that:
  The number of VMID bits is UNSPECIFIED and may be zero. The number of
  implemented VMID bits, termed VMIDLEN, may be determined by writing one
  to every bit position in the VMID field, then reading back the value in
  hgatp to see which bit positions in the VMID field hold a one. The least-
  significant bits of VMID are implemented first: that is, if VMIDLEN &gt; 0,
  VMID[VMIDLEN-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of VMIDLEN, termed
  VMIDMAX, is 7 for Sv32x4 or 14 for Sv39x4, Sv48x4, and Sv57x4..
And I couldn't find explicitly that VMIDLEN will be the same across harts.

Therefore, IMO, while the specification doesn't guarantee VMID will be
different, the "unspecified" nature and the per-hart discovery mechanism
of VMIDLEN in the hgatp CSR allows for VMIDLEN to be different on
different harts in an implementation without violating the
RISC-V privileged specification.

    csr_write(CSR_HGATP, old | HGATP_VMID_MASK);

    vmid_bits = ffs_g(vmid_bits);

And then use uint16_t for vmid_bits and use uin16_t as a return type.

    </blockquote>
    <pre>It could be an issue (or, at least, it is recommended) when hgatp.MODE is
changed:
 If hgatp.MODE is changed for a given VMID, an HFENCE.GVMA with rs1=x0
 (and rs2 set to either x0 or the VMID) must be executed to order subsequent
 guest translations with the MODE changeâ€”even if the old MODE or new MODE
 is Bare.
On other hand it is guaranteed that, at least, on Reset (and so I assume
for power on) that:
 If the hypervisor extension is implemented, the hgatp.MODE and vsatp.MODE
 fields are reset to 0.

So it seems like if no guest is ran then there is no need even to write
hgatp.MODE as zero, but it might be sense to do that explicitly just to
be sure.

I thought it was possible to have a running guest and perform a CPU hotplug.
In that case, I expect that during the hotplug, <code data-start="178"
    data-end="196">vmidlen_detect()</code> will be
called and return the <code data-start="227" data-end="238">vmid_bits</code> value, which is used as the active VMID.
At that moment, the local TLB could be speculatively polluted, I think.
Likely, it makes sense to call vmidlen_detect() only once for each hart
during initial bringup.

In fact, with no guest running (yet) I'm having a hard time seeing why
you shouldn't be able to simply write the register with just
HGATP_VMID_MASK, i.e. without OR-ing in "old". It's even questionable
whether "old" needs restoring; writing plain zero afterwards ought to
suffice. You're in charcge of the register, after all.</pre>

    <pre>It make sense (but I don't know if it is a possible case) to be sure that
HGATP.MODE remains the same, so there is no need to have TLB flush. If
HGATP.MODE is changed then it will be needed to do TLB flush as I mentioned
above.

If we agreed to keep local_hfence_gvma_all() then I think it isn't really
any sense to restore 'old' or OR-ing it with HGATP_VMID_MASK.

Generally if 'old' is guaranteed to be zero (and, probably, it makes sense
to check that in vmidlen_detect() and panic if it isn't zero) and if
vmidlen_detect() function will be called before any guest domain(s) will
be ran then I could agree that we don't need local_hfence_gvma_all() here.

As an option we can do local_hfence_gvma_all() only if 'old' value wasn't
set to zero.

Does it make sense?

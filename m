Subject: [PATCH v5 16/23] docs/man: fix xl(1) documentation for 'pci' operations

From: Paul Durrant <pdurrant@amazon.com>

Currently the documentation completely fails to mention the existence of
PCI_SPEC_STRING. This patch tidies things up, specifically clarifying that
'pci-assignable-add/remove' take <BDF> arguments where as 'pci-attach/detach'
take <PCI_SPEC_STRING> arguments (which will be enforced in a subsequent
patch).

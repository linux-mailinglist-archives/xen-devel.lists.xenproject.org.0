Of course.

The comment is about the asm(); it is neither placed to clearly relate
to __builtin_constant_p(), nor is it saying anything about this specific
property of it. You said you were equally surprised; don't you think
that when both of us are surprised, a specific (even if brief) comment
is warranted?

"Clearest form" is almost always a matter of taste. To me, comparing
unsigned values with > or < against 0 is generally at least suspicious.
Using != is typically better (again: imo), and simply omitting the != 0
then is shorter with no difference in effect. Except in peculiar cases
like this one, where indeed it took me some time to figure why the
comparison operator may not be omitted.

All that said: I'm not going to insist on any change; the R-b previously
offered still stands. I would highly appreciate though if the (further)
comment asked for could be added.

What I definitely dislike here is you - not for the first time - turning
down remarks because a change of yours is late. This feels even more so
bad when considering that I'm typically replying to your patches with
pretty little turnaround. Whereas various of mine, pending in part for
years, do not seem to deserve any review comments at all. Unlike before,
where it was "only" improvements or feature additions, meanwhile even
bug fixes are left sit like that. If I may be blunt: This may not work
this way for much longer. At some point I will need to artificially
delay reviews, making them dependent on my own work also being allowed
to make progress. I question though whether that would be in everyone's
interest.

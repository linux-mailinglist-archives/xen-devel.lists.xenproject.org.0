Yes, it is needed - see below for the very simple patch to Qemu
upstream that fixes it for the "pc" machine!

I was thinking we could also either write a test to verify the correctness
of the second patch to ensure it generates the correct Qemu command line
or take the time to verify the second patch's accuracy before committing it.

I just tested a very simple patch to Qemu upstream to fix the
difference between the upstream Qemu "pc" machine and the upstream
Qemu "xenfv" machine:

With this simple two-line patch to upstream Qemu, we can use the "pc"
machine without any regressions such as the startup performance
degradation I observed without this small patch to fix the "pc" machine
with igd passthru!

The "pc" machine maintainers for upstream Qemu would need to accept
this small patch to Qemu upstream. They might prefer this to the
other Qemu patch that reserves slot 2 for the Qemu upstream "xenfv"
machine when the guest is configured for igd passthru.

Well, the little patch to upstream shown above fixes the "pc" machine
with IGD so maybe this approach of patching libxl to use the "pc" machine
will be a viable fix for the IGD.

I just added the bit of information above to help you decide which
approach to use to improve the support for the igd passthru feature
with Xen and Qemu upstream. I think the test of the small patch to
Qemu to fix the "pc" machine with igd passthru makes this patch to
libxl a viable alternative to the other patch to Qemu upstream that
reserves slot 2 when using the "xenfv" machine and igd passthru.

Thanks,

Chuck

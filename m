I would suggest to make that clear and also point to the documentation 
for the Event Channel ABI (we have a doc for fifo at least).

It depends on whether an admin may have specific a dom0 kernel. Looking 
at Penny series to handle shared memory, it will be possible to create a 
shared region between dom0 and a dom0less domU. Most likely the user 
will also want to provide a notification communication.

So shouldn't we also provide a way to create an event channel between 
dom0 and another domU?

I can understand this request. However...

Also, this is a requirement for the stable

... leaving aside the fact that domctl is clearly not stable today, the 
flag would be rejected on hypervisor not supporting vPCI. So I don't 
really see how this is a requirement for the stable hypercall interface.

Would you mind providing more details?

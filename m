I agree with this and also I agree with Julien's other statement:

"I am strongly in favor of libxl to modify it if it greatly improves the
user experience."

I am always in favor of reducing complexity for the user as they
typically can't deal with tricky details such as MasterIDs. In general,
I think we need more automation with our tooling.

However, it might not be as simple as adding support for automatically
generating IDs in libxl because we have 2 additional cases to support:
1) dom0less
2) statically built guests

For 1) we would need the same support also in Xen? Which means more
complexity in Xen.

2) are guests like Zephyr that consume a device tree at
build time instead of runtime. These guests are built specifically for a
given environment and it is not a problem to rebuild them for every Xen
release.

However I think it is going to be a problem if we have to run libxl to
get the device tree needed for the Zephyr build. That is because it
means that the Zephyr build system would have to learn how to compile
(or crosscompile) libxl in order to retrieve the data needed for its
input. Even for systems based on Yocto (Yocto already knows how to build
libxl) would cause issues because of internal dependencies this would
introduce.

So I think the automatic generation might be best done in another tool.

I think we need something like a script that takes a partial device tree
as input and provides a more detailed partial device tree as output with
the generated IDs.

If we did it that way, we could call the script from libxl, but also we
could call it separately from ImageBuilder for dom0less and Zephyr/Yocto
could also call it.

Basically we make it easier for everyone to use it. The only price to
pay is that it will be a bit less efficient for xl guests (one more
script to fork and exec) but I think is a good compromise.

Another advantage is that in fully static workflows we could call the
script ahead of time (e.g. from Lopper/ImageBuilder) and still have full
knowledge of the device tree of all the guests which is great from a
safety perspective.

I think this is a great idea, I only suggest that we move the automatic
generation out of libxl (a separate stand-alone script), in another
place that can be more easily reused by multiple projects and different
use-cases.

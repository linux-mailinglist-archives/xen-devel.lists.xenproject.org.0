Mostly some style nits, and one comment adjustment.

If you are OK with those:

I think the _with_ part is redundant, but it's certainly shorter than
previously :).

Line length > 80 cols.

I try to avoid referencing function names in comments, as they tend to
get out of sync without noticing.  It's much easier to use cscope to
grep for x2apic_ldr_bug_with_vcpu_id and find the comment itself.

Not sure if we should try to avoid mentioning specific versions in the
comments, as I this fix will be backported to stable branches (I hope),
and hence those will no longer be affected.

I think this is possibly too verbose, I would be fine with just the
first sentence TBH.  If we want the full comment however, the wording
should be slightly addressed: it's not just IPIs that would possibly
fail to be delivered, but any interrupt attempting to target the APIC
using the previous LDR addressing (either an IPI or an external
interrupt).

Could you write the expected values while at it:

"%pv: bogus x2APIC loaded id=%#x ldr=%#x (expected id=%#x ldr=%#x)\n"

I think you already mentioned in a followup reply that using
bug_x2apic_ldr_vcpu_id would be fine.

Thanks, Roger.

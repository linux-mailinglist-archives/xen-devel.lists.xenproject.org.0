Looks like it was never hooked up for PVHv2, and removed together
with a lot of other PVHv1 code by your 33e5c32559e1.

I think the reason PV Dom0 has it applies to PVH Dom0 as well:
At least back at the time there were video BIOSes needing this.
As it now turns out to have been a mistake to not enable the
RTC handling for v2, I would still think it would be better to
enable the PIT logic as well there, just to be on the safe side.

Ah, likely.

FAOD: I didn't mean to suggest I believe this transition would
be working right now. But if someone wanted to make it work,
they shouldn't be put at risk to unknowingly leave the original
dom0 with more permissions than it's supposed to have.
